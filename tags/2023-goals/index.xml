      <title>Intermittent Fasting</title>

      <description>During the original lockdown, I had just gotten out of what was hopefully the worst relationship of my life. I won&amp;rsquo;t explain why this relationship was so bad, those who know - she has caused enough damage and I do not plan to invite anymore. Post break up I had what I think alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity when all of the comforts fall away and you find yourself at rock bottom.</description>

      <title>2023 Goals - March update</title>

      <description>This post is a tad overdue, a timeline of illness to birthday back to illness is to blame for that. I am very much playing catch-up now, intending to publish enough posts to make up for last month&amp;rsquo;s backlog, and this month&amp;rsquo;s quota.
Overall February was somewhat of a success. I fell behind in regards to publishing blog posts and still haven&amp;rsquo;t made successful headway with the book&amp;rsquo;s goals, however in regards to my goals of being healthier and paying off my overdraft I have made progress.</description>

      <title>Diet Drinks are Still Bad</title>
      <link>https://eddiequinn.xyz/posts/2023/feb/diet-drinks-still-bad/</link>

      <description>In a recent post, I mentioned that as part of my trying move towards achieving my 2023 goal of &amp;ldquo;be healthier&amp;rdquo; I was going to quit energy drinks. There are multiple reasons for this, many of which I am going into detail in this post. What I did not quite anticipate is the human mind&amp;rsquo;s ability to move towards something just as bad when a crutch is taken away.
Energy drinks, cigarettes, and car-parks I was emo, and arguably still am based on my Spotify Libary.</description>

      <description>Five days into the second month and I don&amp;rsquo;t appear to have successfully sat down to write a blog post - I must be slacking. This post is more of a self-check-in, to make sure that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to stick to the goals that I set for myself in the new year. It probably is not going to be as thought-provoking as other posts given that context.
Goal 1) Im going to write more This goal is one of those which I want to say was a resounding success - Not only did I write the number of posts I needed to write for that month, I enjoyed it.</description>

      <title>A post where I talk about my weight</title>
      <link>https://eddiequinn.xyz/posts/2023/jan/a-post-where-i-talk-about-my-weight/</link>

      <description>So admittedly this post was going to be a summary of a hacker news thread I saw called Ask HN: What is the best advice you received in 2022. I only recently joined HN, but it gives me a similar warm comfy feeling that old-school Reddit did. It encourages intelligent back-and-forth conversation, where having an unpopular opinion doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically mean some gremlin bans you from commenting again in /r/whatever. In reality, I have only ever been banned from one subreddit, and that was before the CCP levels of over-moderation became commonplace, but that hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped me from watching the site (I once was a happy member of) devolve into the cesspit it is today.</description>

      <description>I made a lot of promises to myself of things I was going to do in 2023 - I overall have followed an interesting path over the past 3 years, and I do consider myself now to be entirely different to the person I was in 2020. I have hinted on this blog prior that I went to university, but have never gone into quite so much detail on my experience there - this blog is not going to be that tell-all, but I will say that I learnt to allot from university (none of it was even remotely related to economics, however).</description>
