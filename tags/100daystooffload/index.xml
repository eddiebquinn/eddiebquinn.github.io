      <description>When I originally wrote this article I was going to go on a massive schpeel about the question of &amp;ldquo;what is art?&amp;rdquo; The questions itself has very little to do with the subject matter of this post, which is why I cut it out. That being said I do not want to discount what I wrote, that being that art itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t have rigid borders of what does and does not fall into the category.</description>

      <description>During the original lockdown, I had just gotten out of what was hopefully the worst relationship of my life. I won&amp;rsquo;t explain why this relationship was so bad, those who know - she has caused enough damage and I do not plan to invite anymore. Post break up I had what I think alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity when all of the comforts fall away and you find yourself at rock bottom.</description>

      <title>2023 Goals - March update</title>

      <description>This post is a tad overdue, a timeline of illness to birthday back to illness is to blame for that. I am very much playing catch-up now, intending to publish enough posts to make up for last month&amp;rsquo;s backlog, and this month&amp;rsquo;s quota.
Overall February was somewhat of a success. I fell behind in regards to publishing blog posts and still haven&amp;rsquo;t made successful headway with the book&amp;rsquo;s goals, however in regards to my goals of being healthier and paying off my overdraft I have made progress.</description>

      <description>I go through phases where I become obsessed with things for a couple of weeks, burn out, and then move on to something else. This cycle continues until a point where I wind up back to being in a fleeting-obsessive state about. The theory behind it, or at least the one that I have always subscribed to is that autistic people become obsessed with this in an attempt to understand it better, and in effect understand the world better.</description>

      <title>Diet Drinks are Still Bad</title>

      <description>In a recent post, I mentioned that as part of my trying move towards achieving my 2023 goal of &amp;ldquo;be healthier&amp;rdquo; I was going to quit energy drinks. There are multiple reasons for this, many of which I am going into detail in this post. What I did not quite anticipate is the human mind&amp;rsquo;s ability to move towards something just as bad when a crutch is taken away.
Energy drinks, cigarettes, and car-parks I was emo, and arguably still am based on my Spotify Libary.</description>

      <description>When I was in sixth form one of the first things I was taught in economics is the law of diminishing marginal returns. LDMR states that as the quantity of a variable input used in production increases, while all other inputs are held constant, the marginal output of that input will eventually decrease. The common way to explain this is with the guns-and-butter framework, which refers to the trade-off between two competing priorities in an economy: military spending (represented by &amp;ldquo;guns&amp;rdquo;) and consumer goods spending (represented by &amp;ldquo;butter&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <description>Five days into the second month and I don&amp;rsquo;t appear to have successfully sat down to write a blog post - I must be slacking. This post is more of a self-check-in, to make sure that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to stick to the goals that I set for myself in the new year. It probably is not going to be as thought-provoking as other posts given that context.
Goal 1) Im going to write more This goal is one of those which I want to say was a resounding success - Not only did I write the number of posts I needed to write for that month, I enjoyed it.</description>

      <description>I am quite a cynical person in general. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is an unfair statement for me to say that I look at most things in life with an air of caution. This is not out of some unfounded paranoia of the world around me, conspiracy theories are fun but most are just fun and games. The thing is though when you look slightly below the surface level on most things you will understand the world is a very ugly place.</description>

      <description>I am reaching an odd point in life, one which I feel many people reach, where I have many many projects I want to work on and very little time to actually dedicate to them. This seems idiotic to actually write a post about, but when you come to accept that very few people actually read your blog, then it becomes more of a self-monologue than a communication to your peers.</description>

      <description>After my recent stint of watching Hunting Hitler, I have found myself in that melancholy state that many do after finishing a good series, riddled with the question &amp;ldquo;what will I use to distract myself from actual tasks now&amp;rdquo;. After watching several case studies of mediocrity that occupy the current low-attention-span-cultural-zeitgeist I found the new Netflix series &amp;ldquo;The Playlist&amp;rdquo;. I am only two episodes in, but from my basic understanding It chronicles the creation of Spotify from multiple points of view.</description>

      <title>The oddly freeing experience of studying in Starbucks</title>
      <link>https://eddiequinn.xyz/posts/2023/jan/studying-in-starbucks/</link>

      <description>I think the lockdown taught a lot of people about themselves. The main thing it shed light on is that a lot of people live their lives in such a way, that &amp;ldquo;social distancing&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t pose such a disruption to their day to day. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I am okay with not having a massive circle of friends, and while a younger version of me would have said that utterly disingenuously, I don&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>So admittedly this post was going to be a summary of a hacker news thread I saw called Ask HN: What is the best advice you received in 2022. I only recently joined HN, but it gives me a similar warm comfy feeling that old-school Reddit did. It encourages intelligent back-and-forth conversation, where having an unpopular opinion doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically mean some gremlin bans you from commenting again in /r/whatever. In reality, I have only ever been banned from one subreddit, and that was before the CCP levels of over-moderation became commonplace, but that hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped me from watching the site (I once was a happy member of) devolve into the cesspit it is today.</description>

      <description>I often find it hard to pick my favourite film or even my top ten favourite films. I have spent the past few years trying to expose myself to the best that the media industry has to offer. I will say that despite all of what I have watched no film has had such a large impact on me, and how I view the world, as Trainspotting. Ironically enough I have never read the original book, despite my long-term intentions to do so.</description>

      <description>I made a lot of promises to myself of things I was going to do in 2023 - I overall have followed an interesting path over the past 3 years, and I do consider myself now to be entirely different to the person I was in 2020. I have hinted on this blog prior that I went to university, but have never gone into quite so much detail on my experience there - this blog is not going to be that tell-all, but I will say that I learnt to allot from university (none of it was even remotely related to economics, however).</description>
