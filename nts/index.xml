      <description>The reason I am writing this note is that I am essentially declaring bankruptcy on my ability to prepare and pack for a trip with no external workflow. If you ever think you do not need this list Ed, I would like to remind you of the following events
Lake district trip - Remember that time you forgot your braces and had to hold your trousers up for two weeks? I do Amsterdam trip - Remember how you have no good way to charge multiple devices at once?</description>

      <description>One of the best things about Unix-based operating systems is how customisable they are. I originally came to Linux as a flex on my other nerdy friends, however, I stayed because for the first time in my life my machine was mine. Most Windows users wouldn&amp;rsquo;t appreciate this, some Linux users may not even - however there is a subset of Linux users who do understand this. ext4 becomes btrfs, sddm becomes ly, gnome/kde becomes BSPWM.</description>
