      <description>So to make a long story short, I have my VPN server up and running using the confiration established in this post title. I do not feel proud of how this was achieved, however, as it feels like cheating. My initial plan, as I have gone over in a lot of depth, was to use Wireguard layered on top of OpenBSD. This quickly became complex, because I was having trouble just installing OpenBSD on the Pi.</description>

      <description>This attempt failed - Reasons why are spoke about in Attempt 1 The task at hand boils down to two sub-tasks&#xA;Installing OpenBSD on a Raspberry Pi 4 Installing and configuring Wireguard on OpenBSD I&amp;rsquo;ll explore the research I&amp;rsquo;ve gathered on these two below&#xA;Installing OpenBSD So I did some research on this last month and found this video of someone who has done it before; this tells me it is at least possible, even if it is not widely covered.</description>
