I am not a car guy - I know a little bit about cars, and have a limited understanding of what people are doing when they install mods onto their cars, but i have never delved into this arcane trade myself. I would like too one day. I saw an interestinmg video a coup;e of months ago where domeone applied the Unix philosphy, that code should do one job and do it well, to hes personal life. This resulted in him having two cars, the reliable work horse and the perpetual project car. If i am ever blessed enough to have my own home and the capital to buy such a perpetual project car, I would like too.

Inspite of my lack of knowledge though, I do know what a governer is. For those not in the know, a governer is a bit of hardware in a car that limits the speed it can go - and thus is born a deeper issue. I bought the car, I theoretically *own* the car; I *should* be able to use my machine to its full capability regardless of what the manufacturer deems fit. It raises some important questions on the nature of ownership, and echos the sentiment "if buying isn't owning, the priacy is not theft".

This post is not about cars, it is about a philosophical quagmire modern tech is in where the items that we buy are not ours, and my ill-advised mission to try and take back some sembeklence of control.

## The Firmware Problem
Too the unaware, when you use your computer, it is made up of a BIOS which loads in hardware, an init system which loads a kernal, and the kernal helps to load in the operating system. There is a certain amount of black magic at play that culminated together in this process which I will not attempt explain here, but at its core that is it. A beautifually sometimes-unelegant achievement of modern hardware and software engineering that allows you to surf the modern day internet to look at everything from ISIS beheading videos to cats being scared of pickles. If your machine was from before 2008, it si very likley that is all it is, but sadly this is not the case for machines spawned past this time-based-load-stone.

The Intel Management Enginer is an autonomous subsystem that has been burned into virtually every Intel processor chipset past that point. Often confused with Intel AMT, it is the case the AMT runs atop ME and is not a distinct system. AMT can also be unprovisioned by owners at will, but there is no official documented process to disable ME. I primarily consdists of proprietrary firmware running on a seperate microprocessor, and as long as the chipset or SoC is supplied with power, it continues to run even if the systemn is turned off. The official reasoning behind this exsisting is that is it aids in the performance of Intel devices. It's exact workings are largesly undocumented, and its code is obsfuscated using cenfidential Huffman tables stored directly in hardware, such that even the firmware does not contian the information neccecary to decode its contents. This subsystem has effectivley ring zero access to the underlying system, with the capability to see storage, the input of peripheral devices such as keyboards and mice, network traffic, and whole host of other capabilties people like pay top dollar for from sites like HAK5.

This is where it goes wrong being fact based to opinion bnased, so please bear that in mind going forward. I am not in the market of beating around the bush, so I will call this what it is - It behaves like something we would call a rootkit if it appeared after purchase. In my opinion *it is* a hardware level rootkit, installed from the assembly line without the informed concent of the enf user.  Under a zero trust worldview, source credibility does not grant architectural exemption - regardless of if Intel ME was sapwned under the perview of a widley trusted Hardware Vendor or a cillified State Level Threat, i treat it the same. Any software on my system that has the capability to perform malicious actions, which I have not personally weighed up the pros and cons of it being on my system and have the inability to remove is malware to me. 

Thus spawns a larger issue which many ignore when it comes this emotionally loaded subject - Your computer is an incredibly customisable thing when you know how to do it. Even something as hardwired in as an Init system is dictated by consumer choice due to the exsistance of systems like Gentoo and Artix Linux. Your laptop is turly yours with relative ease... except for the firmware. This is not about IntelME, this is about the laptops firmware being something which can be updated and tweaked as long as you have the correct signing keys, but the moment I want to flash 3rd party firmware onto my legally owned device I suddenly need to buy an SPI clip and pray I dont brick my motherboard. IntelME is a symptom of a wider problem. If I cannot flash a new firmware onto my device, is it even mine?

## Chromebooks, Coreboot, Cannibalism
Working in IT I have the distinct mispleasure to work with devices running ChromeOS - Most of these devices are lightweight machines that act esentially as thin clients whos entire job is to load up web based applications. Most of my run in's at my job are to do with Google Meet hardware, but they come from the same DNA as chromebooks and are essentially the same high-comsumer slop that will only find a future in a landfill within five to ten years. With my love of taking old and decrepid hardware and breathing new life into it, i felt a moral duty to save the chromebook i now call Spider from this dusty fate. It will be a cold day in hell the day i use ChromeOS however, so if I was going to do this I was installing Nix on it.
