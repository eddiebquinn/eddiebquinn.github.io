      <title>Intermittent Fasting</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the original lockdown, I had just gotten out of what was hopefully the worst relationship of my life. I won&amp;rsquo;t explain why this relationship was so bad, those who know - she has caused enough damage and I do not plan to invite anymore. Post break up I had what I think alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity when all of the comforts fall away and you find yourself at rock bottom. I would write an unpublished post a year after this called &amp;ldquo;the view from halfway down&amp;rdquo;, describing how after a year of self-improvement my foundations cracked and all my progress fell apart. The view from halfway down was a good case study in the sentiment that the hind-site is 20 20. While I did lose weight, conquer many demons, and become a better person overall,  I only manifested these changes due to a melancholic fury at my ex-girlfriend. I am glad I failed because it means I have finally moved on&amp;hellip; I am however still trying to get back to where I was.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is a tad overdue, a timeline of illness to birthday back to illness is to blame for that. I am very much playing catch-up now, intending to publish enough posts to make up for last month&amp;rsquo;s backlog, and this month&amp;rsquo;s quota.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall February was &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; of a success. I fell behind in regards to publishing blog posts and still haven&amp;rsquo;t made successful headway with the book&amp;rsquo;s goals, however in regards to my goals of being healthier and paying off my overdraft I have made progress. All of these will be expanded on below&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Diet Drinks are Still Bad</title>
      <link>https://eddiequinn.xyz/posts/2023/feb/diet-drinks-still-bad/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent post, I mentioned that as part of my trying move towards achieving my 2023 goal of &amp;ldquo;be healthier&amp;rdquo; I was going to quit energy drinks. There are multiple reasons for this, many of which I am going into detail in this post. What I did not quite anticipate is the human mind&amp;rsquo;s ability to move towards something just as bad when a crutch is taken away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;energy-drinks-cigarettes-and-car-parks&#34;&gt;Energy drinks, cigarettes, and car-parks&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was emo, and arguably still am based on my Spotify Libary. Growing up in the 2010s as an emo was a very odd experience. I think it is best personified by a Facebook post I read once that said &amp;ldquo;the girls look like boys, the boys look like girls, and all of them don&amp;rsquo;t seem to understand why they are sexually confused&amp;rdquo;. Looking back it wasn&amp;rsquo;t counterculture, nor was it rebellious in any way - It was just cringe. From the incessant Facebook posts going &lt;code&gt;RAWR - Dat means I wub woo in dinosaur&lt;/code&gt; or the ongoing feud between BVB fans and metal heads that didn&amp;rsquo;t consider it &amp;ldquo;real metal&amp;rdquo;, the whole 7-year epoch for me was borderline ridiculous. There are some experiences I have had where if I was allowed to go back I would still do it, just for the experience. This is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Five days into the second month and I don&amp;rsquo;t appear to have successfully sat down to write a blog post - I must be slacking. This post is more of a self-check-in, to make sure that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to stick to the goals that I set for myself in the new year. It probably is not going to be as thought-provoking as other posts given that context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;goal-1-im-going-to-write-more&#34;&gt;Goal 1) Im going to write more&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This goal is one of those which I want to say was a resounding success - Not only did I write the number of posts I needed to write for that month, I enjoyed it. I have always enjoyed writing, and I have always intended to kick off with blogging  - however intending is akin to &amp;ldquo;would of, should of, could of&amp;rdquo;. I somewhat think the &amp;ldquo;100daysofoffload&amp;rdquo; challenge was the kick up the backside I needed to start writing regularly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A post where I talk about my weight</title>
      <link>https://eddiequinn.xyz/posts/2023/jan/a-post-where-i-talk-about-my-weight/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So admittedly this post was going to be a summary of a hacker news thread I saw called &lt;code&gt;Ask HN: What is the best advice you received in 2022&lt;/code&gt;. I only recently joined HN, but it gives me a similar warm comfy feeling that old-school Reddit did. It encourages intelligent back-and-forth conversation, where having an unpopular opinion doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically mean some gremlin bans you from commenting again in &lt;code&gt;/r/whatever&lt;/code&gt;. In reality, I have only ever been banned from one subreddit, and that was before the CCP levels of over-moderation became commonplace, but that hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped me from watching the site (I once was a happy member of) devolve into the cesspit it is today. Despite this tangent, this post is also not about Reddit, more than one person has chronicled that site&amp;rsquo;s devolution far better than I ever could.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My goals for 2023</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made a lot of promises to myself of things I was going to do in 2023 - I overall have followed an interesting path over the past 3 years, and I do consider myself now to be entirely different to the person I was in 2020. I have hinted on this blog prior that I went to university, but have never gone into quite so much detail on my experience there - this blog is not going to be that tell-all, but I will say that I learnt to allot from university (none of it was even remotely related to economics, however). There does remain the fact however that there are parts of who I am that I want to improve, and I want to dedicate 2023 to that purpose&lt;/p&gt;</description>
