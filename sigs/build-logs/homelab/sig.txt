For a very long time, I have wanted to get a home lab up and running. This is for various reasons ranging from it being cheaper than renting VPSs, to it allowing me to hone my skills in running a data centre (albeit small). Officially my self-hosting journey began in 2020, and I even ran some projects on-prem, however for the sake of avoiding issues when I experienced a power outage many of my projects migrated to hosting providers. However, I have officially taken the first step in getting my home lab up and running.
