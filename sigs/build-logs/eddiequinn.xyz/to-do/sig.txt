As with all projects of mine, there is a list of things which I want to do with it when I find the time to do so. This is said list

- - **Automate build process to occur daily -** So in its current iteration my site is built by running `hugo -t risotto` and then committing any changes to the public submodule. It is then auto-built using GitHub pages. In an ideal world, this would all happen on a daily basis automatically, and this will be possible through the use of GitHub actions. I am however putting this on the back burner for now - The reason behind this is that as my homelab is built out further I eventually want to run a [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) and [GitTea](https://about.gitea.com/) server. Given this, I do not want to write out an automation file for GitHub when I will eventually have to write a separate one later on.
- - **Set up TOR site -** I eventually want to set up my site so it runs as a TOR-Hidden-Service. Why? Because it's cool. The actual catalyst for my wanting to do this was Network Chucks video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CurcakgurRE). I am however relucatant to do this until I have set up the automated build process. The reason behind this is that I would be able to use that to automatically pull the site files on the host.
- - **Set up a linktree page -** This is something I have wanted to do for a while, and for the longest time, I wanted to do it using an open-source solution like [linktees](https://github.com/heysagnik/Linkees). In reality, I do not have anything nearly as complex as this, just a page on my site showing all my links. I would however like to have it set up so it's not just a series of hyperlinks - I can possibly use [SimpleIcons](https://simpleicons.org/) to do this. I'll think about it. This *possibly* could present some issues for when I deploy a TOR site, as these links would likely lead to the clear net - for that reason, it's important I put on a banner stating this.
- - **Security.txt -** I might have one of these already, I doubt it though. One possible resource to do this in the future is [here](https://github.com/davidsneighbour/hugo-modules/tree/main/modules/security).
