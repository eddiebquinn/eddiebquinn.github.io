I won't make excuses on where I have been, it is a running joke on this blog that no one reads this (other one of my friends with a rodent agacent moniker) so who am I really apologising too? I set myself a series of goals at the start of the year. I am halfway through the year and I wanted to touch base with how these goals are going.

Before delving deeping into this however I do want to say that I fully antiicapted that my goals would change as the year went on. A year is both an amazing short and long time, but being the way I am the standards and beleifs I hold change like the tide. It is for this reason I tried to make some of the goals themseves vauge. I wanted to leave them open ended enough that they could withstand changes to myself as the year went on. If I have chosen to drop some of these goals it is not a cop out, it is as admission that I am placing it onto a shelf as I cannot dedidcate the right amount of time too it.

## I want to write more
I want to say that over all this has been a sucsess. At the start of the year I did intend to do a challenge called `100 days of offload` where I would post 100 posts in a 365 day period. I have since then dropped this goal. The reason for this is because I have come to understand that I do actually really enjoy writing, and it is a very effective anchoring technique.

The 100 days challenge encourages you to *"just write"*. There is nothing wrong with this, it is usually the advice I give to people who want to pick up a new skill. Stop thinking about it and just do it. For the first few months this worded for me, however I did eventually begin to question why I am writing and what I want my writing to achieve. I came to the conclusion that I do not want to write for the sake of writing, else I am just regurgitating the static noise that is common place on this net. There is a reason why I do not use twitter or mastadon, and it is because I do not feel I can coherently inflict my opinions in that format. I feel my writing makes more sense in long form, thought out, blog posts.

I have however developed a somewhat of a production line for this. When I have an idea I will put it into my todo list, and then it will stew there untill I either delete it or write a first draft. That first draft is written with zero regard for spelling mistakes or gramatical errors, it is just written with the intnet of getting thought on paper (or markdown editor i suppose). I will then eventually proof read it and publish it. This is why posts may be dated weeks prior to the publication. This system is not pretty, and its not even very coherent, but it works for me and my current system.

It does make me question on where I want to go with this habit in the long term. Do I just want to limit myself to blog posts? I have for a while considered the idea of writing a book, and I even have an idea of what I want it to be about. A letter to pre lock downn me telling myself that grow up and take responsbility for hes life. I will shelf that idea for now, but I think it is definatley something that should be considered in the future.

## I am going to be healthier
This is another thing which I have made preogress with but I equally need to perform mainteance. I still have quit engergy drinks, but I have began to let takeaways creep back in. This goals was always made with the intent to be open ended. When you look at me with the lens of health it is abundantly obvious that the main thing wrong is my weight. I have done yo yo dieting in the past and I have discovered to things

1) Loosing weight is as simple as cosume less calories than you burn
2) Loosing weight is infinatley more comples than consume less calories than you burn

With enough will power I can loose weight, and quite allot of it. The problem is not willpower however, the problem is that I am trying to undo 25 year's of bad habbits. The solution is not an extreeme diet like carnivore, or mucas free, or paleo. The solution is to make small long term changes i.e. quitting energy drinks or limiting the amount of take out I order.

The objective i want to bring in however is this

**I want to stop eating at my work canteen**
The food at the canteen where I work is shit. I dont care who reads this, or even if someone from work reads this. The food is absolute dog shit. It is not only disgusting, it also does disgusting things to my digestive tract (I will spare you the horrific food poisining spat i went through). I have said for a while I do not want to eat it anymore, and after a co-worker said he was now ordering ready meals from muscle food to eat at work, I saw my opertunity. My goal this month is to maintain my previous progress and stop eating the canteen food.

## I aam going to have no account overdrawn
Oh boy. Okay so the strat here has taken a slight change. So before I was following Dave Ramseys model of how to get out of debt of "save Â£1000 and then put all excess income into clearing debt". This has been a game changer, and the reason for it is there are very problems in this life that cant be solved by just having Â£1000 laying around. The main issue is that I would always find an excuse to mess it up i.e. taking money out of the emergency fund, or not paying money into the overdrawn account.

The stratergy has changed based on two lessons
1) The idea of paying yourself first from rich dad poor dad
2) "Just pay the money in on standing order" from my mum

With every paycheck I dedicate Â£250 to paying off that debt. It does not matter how much I earn, or how much my emergency fund is repleated. I pay back my overdraft first. If I keep doing this I will either have it paid off by the end of he year, or be very close to having it paid off by the end of the year.

Based on this, this goal is on track to be achieved.

## I want to read more
This is DOA at this point. I read a while back something saying "if you don't enjoy something, don't force yourself to do it becasue youll grow to hate it more". I just dont have the energy to read at this point in my life. One day this will be a goal but at the moment it just isnt something I want to focus on
