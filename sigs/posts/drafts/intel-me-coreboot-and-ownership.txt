I am not a car guy - I know a little bit about cars, and have a limited understanding of what people are doing when they install mods onto their cars, but i have never delved into this arcane trade myself. I would like too one day. I saw an interestinmg video a coup;e of months ago where domeone applied the Unix philosphy, that code should do one job and do it well, to hes personal life. This resulted in him having two cars, the reliable work horse and the perpetual project car. If i am ever blessed enough to have my own home and the capital to buy such a perpetual project car, I would like too.

Inspite of my lack of knowledge though, I do know what a governer is. For those not in the know, a governer is a bit of hardware in a car that limits the speed it can go - and thus is born a deeper issue. I bought the car, I theoretically *own* the car; I *should* be able to use my machine to its full capability regardless of what the manufacturer deems fit. It raises some important questions on the nature of ownership, and echos the sentiment "if buying isn't owning, the priacy is not theft".

This post is not about cars, it is about a philosophical quagmire modern tech is in where the items that we buy are not ours, and my ill-advised mission to try and take back some sembeklence of control.

## The Firmware Problem
Too the unaware, when you use your computer, it is made up of a BIOS which loads in hardware, an init system which loads a kernal, and the kernal helps to load in the operating system. There is a certain amount of black magic at play that culminated together in this process which I will not attempt explain here, but at its core that is it. A beautifually sometimes-unelegant achievement of modern hardware and software engineering that allows you to surf the modern day internet to look at everything from ISIS beheading videos to cats being scared of pickles. If your machine was from before 2008, it si very likley that is all it is, but sadly this is not the case for machines spawned past this time-based-load-stone.

The Intel Management Enginer is an autonomous subsystem that has been burned into virtually every Intel processor chipset past that point. Often confused with Intel AMT, it is the case the AMT runs atop ME and is not a distinct system. AMT can also be unprovisioned by owners at will, but there is no official documented process to disable ME. I primarily consdists of proprietrary firmware running on a seperate microprocessor, and as long as the chipset or SoC is supplied with power, it continues to run even if the systemn is turned off. The official reasoning behind this exsisting is that is it aids in the performance of Intel devices. It's exact workings are largesly undocumented, and its code is obsfuscated using cenfidential Huffman tables stored directly in hardware, such that even the firmware does not contian the information neccecary to decode its contents. This subsystem has effectivley ring zero access to the underlying system, with the capability to see storage, the input of peripheral devices such as keyboards and mice, network traffic, and whole host of other capabilties people like pay top dollar for from sites like HAK5.

This is where it goes wrong being fact based to opinion bnased, so please bear that in mind going forward. I am not in the market of beating around the bush, so I will call this what it is - It behaves like something we would call a rootkit if it appeared after purchase. In my opinion *it is* a hardware level rootkit, installed from the assembly line without the informed concent of the enf user.  Under a zero trust worldview, source credibility does not grant architectural exemption - regardless of if Intel ME was sapwned under the perview of a widley trusted Hardware Vendor or a cillified State Level Threat, i treat it the same. Any software on my system that has the capability to perform malicious actions, which I have not personally weighed up the pros and cons of it being on my system and have the inability to remove is malware to me. 

Thus spawns a larger issue which many ignore when it comes this emotionally loaded subject - Your computer is an incredibly customisable thing when you know how to do it. Even something as hardwired in as an Init system is dictated by consumer choice due to the exsistance of systems like Gentoo and Artix Linux. Your laptop is turly yours with relative ease... except for the firmware. This is not about IntelME, this is about the laptops firmware being something which can be updated and tweaked as long as you have the correct signing keys, but the moment I want to flash 3rd party firmware onto my legally owned device I suddenly need to buy an SPI clip and pray I dont brick my motherboard. IntelME is a symptom of a wider problem. If I cannot flash a new firmware onto my device, is it even mine?

## Chromebooks, Coreboot, Cannibalism
Working in IT I have the distinct mispleasure to work with devices running ChromeOS - Most of these devices are lightweight machines that act esentially as thin clients whos entire job is to load up web based applications. Most of my run in's at my job are to do with Google Meet hardware, but they come from the same DNA as chromebooks and are essentially the same high-comsumer slop that will only find a future in a landfill within five to ten years. With my love of taking old and decrepid hardware and breathing new life into it, i felt a moral duty to save the chromebook i now call Spider from this dusty fate. It will be a cold day in hell the day i use ChromeOS however, so if I was going to do this I was installing Nix on it.

Several years piror I had a girlfriend who had a chromebook she was using for her maths degree and asked me to try and help me get Ububtu Installed so she could use R studio. I did some research into it and saw it was possible, but before i had a chance to actually do it she bought a new laptop. Also the EOL google meet hardware in my job, I habve had collegues install iGelOS onto to use as thin clients. So I *knew* this was possiblke, what I did not know was how absolutley cursed the process of doing this is. 

Before I actually get into this
1) [Mr.Chromebox](https://docs.mrchromebox.tech) - God send.
2) This is not a tutorial, do this at your own risk

Flashing a Chromebook isn’t difficult in the way installing Linux on a normal laptop is difficult — it’s difficult in the way prying open something that was never meant to be opened is difficult. ChromeOS devices are built around verified boot and vendor-controlled firmware, so even after enabling developer mode you’re still boxed in. To actually replace the firmware you often have to physically open the machine, disable hardware write protection, and negotiate with firmware regions and rollback protections that clearly weren’t designed with user sovereignty in mind. My one involved opening up the device and removing a screw to disabled write protection - Yes a physical screw.

I do need to clarify something here, I understand the need for an OS as locked down as this is. Chromebooks are not meant to be sold to induvidual users, they usualy exsist in fleet dynamics in education and corperate enviroments. As someone who works and supports devices like this, having the peace of mind the users cannot easily fuck with their device is something I wish was as prevelant in Dell's as it is Chromebooks. My contention is around the fact these devices can be sold on, and if they are not useable in the second hand market they will just become ewaste.

AAn interesting caveat of this process however, due to the locked down nature of the firmware in many cases you need to outright replace it. 9/10 this will be with Coreboot — not an operating system, not a Linux distribution, but the firmware itself. Coreboot replaces the vendor’s BIOS/UEFI with something leaner and far more transparent about what it is actually doing. Its job is deliberately minimal: initialise the hardware, set the stage, and then hand control off to a payload like SeaBIOS or Tianocore, which in turn boots your operating system. You are not just installing Nix or Ubuntu at that point; you are rewriting the machine’s brain. It does not magically purge every proprietary component from the silicon, and it does not turn a Chromebook into a libre utopia overnight, but it fundamentally shifts who gets to decide how the device wakes up and what it trusts.

So I turned it on and it just worked. I know you probably want some dramatic drawn out sequence of "I sat there staring at the black screen waitng for any sign of life, and as the fans creaked to life and the rabbit appeared on screen i felt vindiacted in this mission". No, it turned on, I pulled my Nix config and it just worked. Well... Kind of. Chromebooks work great with ChromeOS and that is because the Hardware, Firmware, and Software are designed to work in harmony. The moment you start fuckiong with it the system becomes allot less stable. As an example, right now I can use VsCode, do git commits, use my homelab apps... But opening KeePassXC is painful, youtube barley funtions, and any conversation with ChaptGPT more than a few messages is just rage inducing.

## Canibalism?
I, like many in the linux sphere, have a certain predispostion for the classic thinkpads. I have been the proud owner of an X230 for sometime, which i bought for the express purpose of Corebooting. I have just never done it. The reasons behind this are simmilar to the reasons I have no put GrapheneOS on my Pixel, despite the fact i bought that phone for the express purpose of doing so... There is allot of work that needs to go into place prior to the act itself.

With the Pixel i needed to get a replacement for google photos, set up a way to sync my contacts, cross all my i's and dot all my t's. With the X230, i need to do research into how to actually install coreboot (or libreboot) on it. The later sounds allot simpler as allot less physical work needs to go into it, but I assur you it is not. This is the sort of thing where once you have done it once it is incredibly simple, but as a first timer it is nerve racking. I am effectively going to be removing my motherboard, putting an SPI clip onto one of the chips and programming it using a CH341A, all of which come with their own caveats - most of all the CH341A, with libreboot themselves say you shouldn't use it, where as every single tutorial I have seen seems to use one. Taking this aside, I know me - Corebooting it will not be enough and i will soon follow the entire [xyte.ch](https://xyte.ch) build process. 

But here is the rub... I like using a corebooted laptop. I find myself between the rock and a hardplace of not being able to stand using this Chromebook, and not wanting to rush this X230 build.
