My homelab journey can be seperated into two key peroids
- - **old-net -** This was a two-pi bramble that exsisted prior to me moving out
- - **bartmos-1 -** This the current state

I have kept the build logs for `old-net`, however these are no longer maintained. They are there just to keep record of what I did and that alone. Please do not attempt to follow them as a guide, not give me critiques on what I did. I have not changed these at all, including the tense they are prestened in or spelling mistakes.
