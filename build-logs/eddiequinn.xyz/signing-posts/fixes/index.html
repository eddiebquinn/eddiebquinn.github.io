        <p>I cannot spend too much time on this post because I have other things to do today. I have found possible solutions to all of the problems I mentioned in <a href="/build-logs/eddiequinn.xyz/signing-posts/mvp/">the previous post</a>. As per usual I have made a dog&rsquo;s ear over a very simple problem. I was however along the right lines with my previous idea of having an auto-sign script</p>
<h2 id="the-issues">The issues</h2>
<p>The way I see it there are three key issues</p>
<p><strong>1) Auto-signing -</strong> I need a script to auto-sign the posts, because doing it by hand is tedious and I want to make it easier for me to write posts rather than harder
<strong>2) Post-sign formatting -</strong> There are &ldquo;issues&rdquo; (not really issues, it&rsquo;s done for a reason) with gpg where it replaces &ldquo;-&rdquo; with &ldquo;&ndash;&rdquo; with a space between. It also converts the document to ASCII rather than UTF-8. This means the resulting text is sometimes mangled in some way.
<strong>3) Writing environment -</strong> Because I can&rsquo;t use <code>hugo server</code> to see a live rendering of the site, this makes things difficult</p>
<p>There are other issues but look at the previous post for those.</p>
<h2 id="the-solutions">The solutions</h2>
<p>The solution(s) are fairly simple. I don&rsquo;t know why I got it in my head that I need to have the posts saved in the git repo signed. The fact is it&rsquo;s a private repo, and will become even more private when I eventually put them on my git server i.e. they will never be seen publically. If I just write an auto-sign script that signs the posts during the publication process, then all my problems are solved.</p>
<p>The auto-signing script is inherently going to be solved, evidenced by its meer existence. The post sign formatting will be solved because I do not need to convert the posts back to their original state post sign - this does present a minor issue that the post and the signed post may have minor differences, but that can be clarified in the post explaining this. The writing environment problem is solved, because I would be able to render the live site again</p>
<h2 id="why-havent-i-dont-this-yet">Why haven&rsquo;t I dont this yet</h2>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done this yet because, despite my LARPing as a programmer, I am a glorified script kiddie. This is not to say I can&rsquo;t do it, because I can, after all, I wrote the last script. It is me saying that a script like this, which would take some of my friends half an hour, might take a few hours for me. I&rsquo;ll get around to it though.</p>
