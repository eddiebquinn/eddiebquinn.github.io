      <title>So... I Guess I&#39;m Learning DevOps?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As promised, another post (whoopie).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My blog has needed a bit of TLC for a while. Some of these are backend issues related to the build process and some of these are front end issues. The main one you will notice is that there is no longer an annoying &lt;code&gt;$echo $LANG&lt;/code&gt; line at the bottom of every post. This was an artifact of the theme I&amp;rsquo;m using, fairly easily fixed by setting a site-specific version of the lang.html file. The RSS feed is still showing duplicate entries (one for the post, one for the PGP signature). I haven&amp;rsquo;t fixed it yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s on my radar. What is most important however is that the site builds without error. So what does this mean? It means I can finally dip my toe into the wonderful world of DevOps. Yay?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>I&#39;m not dead</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a bit of a joke that I play on many people that when they say &amp;ldquo;How are you&amp;rdquo; I will respond with &amp;ldquo;I am not dead&amp;rdquo;. Some laugh it off, some say it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a dismal thing to say, and some respond with &amp;ldquo;same&amp;rdquo;. I have always found it very interesting to see how others respond to this. I often can tell how well I will get on with them based entirely on the response. In any case, given it has been more than a year since my last post I feel the need to say that I am not dead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My Goals for 2024</title>
      <link>https://eddiequinn.xyz/posts/2023/dec/2024-goals/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the start of this year, I started it with a list of goals - At the start of the year, I did regular updates on these goals, and have tried to keep these as the year has gone. Given this year is coming to an end I would like to do a closing post on these goals and how they went, and posit some goals for 2024. I will say, that even though some of these goals were not achieved, having these at the back of my mind has been a good help in actually making sure I achieved something in 2023. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did it, and I think this system was far more effective than my typical &amp;ldquo;I want to lose weight&amp;rdquo; New year&amp;rsquo;s resolution before this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been studying for my Network+ for the last few months. In doing so I have learnt to appreciate the inner workings of networking infrastructure, and how the modern-day internet functions and came to be. Truly, just for you to be reading this page is nothing short of a miracle - There is an incredibly noisy world just out of the scope of our senses that most people will never get a chance to learn about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of you may remember earlier on in the year I went through a phase of wanting to sign my posts with PGP. This plan fell to the wayside fairly quickly and got &amp;ldquo;placed on the backburner&amp;rdquo; i.e. I will fix this when I figure out how. Well, after finding myself away from work for a week I have taken the time to figure this out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;taking-advantage-of-the-new-feature&#34;&gt;Taking advantage of the new feature&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I get into how I did this I want to clarify how you can take advantage of this new feature. Every post now has an accompanying plaintext page showing the signature. An example of this is the section page for the signing posts project&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PGP in Depth</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you pay attention to this site some of you may have noticed the inclusion of a new section of the site called build-logs. It essentially covers progress notes on various projects I am working on. One major project I am working on regarding this site is setting up automated PGP signing of the posts on it. I gave a brief explanation of how PGP works in one of the posts in that section, and I feel it gives a good and clear explanation of the concept of public key cryptography to a layman. I have however, for the longest time, wanted to do an in-depth explanation of how PGP works - this is not only because there seem to be very few non-academic resources on the subject, but also to bolster my understanding of the subject. This post is just that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Where Do Governments Derive Their Right to Rule</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I am a libertarian - I hold opinions that are controversial in a traditional sense, but when you boil them down to their core sentiments, most people share. An example of this, I feel that gun ownership should be liberalised. The typical first reaction to this is &amp;ldquo;Oh so you don&amp;rsquo;t care at all about kids being murdered?&amp;rdquo;, which can be translated to &amp;ldquo;I disagree with your statement&amp;rdquo;. However, when I express my reasoning behind it, most people come to understand that the pro/anti-gun argument is a tad more complex than &amp;ldquo;gun kills person, and kil is bad&amp;rdquo;. They may not agree with my point, but that isn&amp;rsquo;t what is important. This is not the post for this argument, but my point is that most people&amp;rsquo;s relationship with politics is not nearly as nuanced as they think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite anticipate writing about this particular post. It started as me wanting to write down a list of everything I should bring with me when I travel for future reference. I however have found myself in a spot where I am quite taken aback by an event, and feel for the sake of my future self I need to write down my current thoughts to reflect on at some point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I tried to write a post yesterday about this topic, but it became a rambly mess about how I want to start a photography project. I have changed a lot since 2020, and at points, I am still trying to decide if it is for the better or the worse. In one way, I have become more self-reliant and grown up a lot. In another way, I have become more cynical and mistrusting of those around me. My therapist would say that when people get hurt they adopt defense mechanisms to prevent it from happening again. Post-breakup with a certain girl I became very determined not to ever be in the position I was in again. That was a lost and depressed skin suit of a boy who had just been emotionally abused for close to six months. I changed a lot because of that, for the first time in my life I began to take responsibility for my happiness. For the first time in my life, I told people no. For the first time in my life, I moved away from larping &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t care what other people think of me&amp;rdquo; and lived it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day I was going through my RSS feeds and I encountered this article&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kotaku.com/reddit-third-party-3rd-apps-pricing-crush-ios-android-1850493992&#34;&gt;Reddit Is Killing The Best Way To Read The Site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thought that instantly entered my head was &amp;ldquo;the best way to use reddit is to not use it at all&amp;rdquo;. I have mentioned before how I think reddit, inspite of my fond memories of it during the 2010&amp;rsquo;s, is a case study of everything wrong with the modern day internet. When i mentioned this before I said one day I would explain why I feel this, and lo-and-behold here we are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was in secondary school at some point a realisation hit me, this realisation as time has gone on I have discovered is only a partial truth. Relying on this assumption on a general basis to make sense of human behavior is not an effective way to do it on general basis, but it can be an effective model to understand some of it. The assumption is as such:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In January of 2023, I went to Amsterdam with a friend - Following my coming back I was going to make a post on the total sensory overload that I experienced there but I never got around to it. I had always wanted to go to Amsterdam, and now I have gone I fully intend to go back before the year is out. This post is not me chronicling that adventure, the truth is that spending two days smoking weed with my Dutch friend is just not that interesting of a story. On the train journey over the person I was traveling with introduced me to an app called &amp;ldquo;be you&amp;rdquo;. To the best of my knowledge, the point of the app is that at a random point in the day, you will be prompted to take a photo of yourself or something you are doing, and this doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you a chance to curate your life. I think in theory it&amp;rsquo;s meant to break you away from presenting the &amp;ldquo;perfect Instagram life&amp;rdquo; that you lead. My friend seemed proud of this app and what she was doing with it, I on the other hand was reminded of Ted Kasycnski.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have mentioned my job on this blog a couple of times. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into that much detail about it - This has very little to do with any rules and regulations on my job itself, it is more related to I have found it to be best practice not to discuss these things online. That being said my continuous professional development and my job itself exist in different domains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I originally wrote this article I was going to go on a massive schpeel about the question of &amp;ldquo;what is art?&amp;rdquo; The questions itself has very little to do with the subject matter of this post, which is why I cut it out. That being said I do not want to discount what I wrote, that being that art itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t have rigid borders of what does and does not fall into the category. It instead holds characteristics, and these characteristics are loose enough that almost anything can be shoehorned into that definition. The main characteristic is that art invokes a response, and this response may be positive or negative. I will one day do a post where I discuss my brief stint working as a security guard in a modern art museum, but today I am going to discuss Tenet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the original lockdown, I had just gotten out of what was hopefully the worst relationship of my life. I won&amp;rsquo;t explain why this relationship was so bad, those who know - she has caused enough damage and I do not plan to invite anymore. Post break up I had what I think alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity when all of the comforts fall away and you find yourself at rock bottom. I would write an unpublished post a year after this called &amp;ldquo;the view from halfway down&amp;rdquo;, describing how after a year of self-improvement my foundations cracked and all my progress fell apart. The view from halfway down was a good case study in the sentiment that the hind-site is 20 20. While I did lose weight, conquer many demons, and become a better person overall,  I only manifested these changes due to a melancholic fury at my ex-girlfriend. I am glad I failed because it means I have finally moved on&amp;hellip; I am however still trying to get back to where I was.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is a tad overdue, a timeline of illness to birthday back to illness is to blame for that. I am very much playing catch-up now, intending to publish enough posts to make up for last month&amp;rsquo;s backlog, and this month&amp;rsquo;s quota.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall February was &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; of a success. I fell behind in regards to publishing blog posts and still haven&amp;rsquo;t made successful headway with the book&amp;rsquo;s goals, however in regards to my goals of being healthier and paying off my overdraft I have made progress. All of these will be expanded on below&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I go through phases where I become obsessed with things for a couple of weeks, burn out, and then move on to something else. This cycle continues until a point where I wind up back to being in a fleeting-obsessive state about. The theory behind it, or at least the one that I have always subscribed to is that autistic people become obsessed with this in an attempt to understand it better, and in effect understand the world better. Regardless of the reasons behind, it this is part of who I am.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Diet Drinks are Still Bad</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent post, I mentioned that as part of my trying move towards achieving my 2023 goal of &amp;ldquo;be healthier&amp;rdquo; I was going to quit energy drinks. There are multiple reasons for this, many of which I am going into detail in this post. What I did not quite anticipate is the human mind&amp;rsquo;s ability to move towards something just as bad when a crutch is taken away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;energy-drinks-cigarettes-and-car-parks&#34;&gt;Energy drinks, cigarettes, and car-parks&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was emo, and arguably still am based on my Spotify Libary. Growing up in the 2010s as an emo was a very odd experience. I think it is best personified by a Facebook post I read once that said &amp;ldquo;the girls look like boys, the boys look like girls, and all of them don&amp;rsquo;t seem to understand why they are sexually confused&amp;rdquo;. Looking back it wasn&amp;rsquo;t counterculture, nor was it rebellious in any way - It was just cringe. From the incessant Facebook posts going &lt;code&gt;RAWR - Dat means I wub woo in dinosaur&lt;/code&gt; or the ongoing feud between BVB fans and metal heads that didn&amp;rsquo;t consider it &amp;ldquo;real metal&amp;rdquo;, the whole 7-year epoch for me was borderline ridiculous. There are some experiences I have had where if I was allowed to go back I would still do it, just for the experience. This is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was in sixth form one of the first things I was taught in economics is the law of diminishing marginal returns. LDMR states that as the quantity of a variable input used in production increases, while all other inputs are held constant, the marginal output of that input will eventually decrease. The common way to explain this is with the guns-and-butter framework, which refers to the trade-off between two competing priorities in an economy: military spending (represented by &amp;ldquo;guns&amp;rdquo;) and consumer goods spending (represented by &amp;ldquo;butter&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Five days into the second month and I don&amp;rsquo;t appear to have successfully sat down to write a blog post - I must be slacking. This post is more of a self-check-in, to make sure that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to stick to the goals that I set for myself in the new year. It probably is not going to be as thought-provoking as other posts given that context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;goal-1-im-going-to-write-more&#34;&gt;Goal 1) Im going to write more&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This goal is one of those which I want to say was a resounding success - Not only did I write the number of posts I needed to write for that month, I enjoyed it. I have always enjoyed writing, and I have always intended to kick off with blogging  - however intending is akin to &amp;ldquo;would of, should of, could of&amp;rdquo;. I somewhat think the &amp;ldquo;100daysofoffload&amp;rdquo; challenge was the kick up the backside I needed to start writing regularly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am quite a cynical person in general. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is an unfair statement for me to say that I look at most things in life with an air of caution. This is not out of some unfounded paranoia of the world around me, conspiracy theories are fun but most are just fun and games. The thing is though when you look slightly below the surface level on most things you will understand the world is a very ugly place. Despite my love of technology, I have always approached the concept of artificial intelligence with an atmosphere of discontent. Perhaps it is due to thought experiments like Rokos Basilisk or the disturbing imagery of &amp;ldquo;I have no mouth but I must scream&amp;rdquo;. I am reluctant to say AI is the biggest threat to humanity in our current epoch, but I am also unwilling to write off that statement as total fiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am reaching an odd point in life, one which I feel many people reach, where I have many many projects I want to work on and very little time to actually dedicate to them. This seems idiotic to actually write a post about, but when you come to accept that very few people actually read your blog, then it becomes more of a self-monologue than a communication to your peers. I am writing this for myself to organise my thoughts around this topic. I read an article earlier last year about the act of &amp;lsquo;selfish writing&amp;rsquo;, and how writing with the intent of entertaining others and writing with the intent of entertaining yourself do not always go hand in hand. I could write a post with the intent to inform or describe how to harden an SSH server, and I have in the past. However, thousands of others do the same. I do not personally want to write that, and the community does not need another tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LOL Limewire</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After my recent stint of watching Hunting Hitler, I have found myself in that melancholy state that many do after finishing a good series, riddled with the question &amp;ldquo;what will I use to distract myself from actual tasks now&amp;rdquo;. After watching several case studies of mediocrity that occupy the current low-attention-span-cultural-zeitgeist I found the new Netflix series &amp;ldquo;The Playlist&amp;rdquo;. I am only two episodes in, but from my basic understanding It chronicles the creation of Spotify from multiple points of view. What I find interesting is that The Pirate Bay(TPB) plays a central role in the creation of Spotify, what I find more interesting is the series not wanting to chronicle the point of view of the &amp;ldquo;pirates&amp;rdquo; that occupied the space then. This makes sense because fundamentally the pirates didn&amp;rsquo;t play a direct part in the creation of Spotify, they were more of a competitor than anything. Watching this did take me back however to the undying advocacy for freedom of information that torrenting brought on during my time in this period. I was a pirate back then. While I try to be a functioning member of society currently, (predominately because of the groundwork laid by platforms like Spotify), I can&amp;rsquo;t help but notice the entertainment industry making many of the same mistakes that lead to the widespread adoption of TPB back then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The oddly freeing experience of studying in Starbucks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the lockdown taught a lot of people about themselves. The main thing it shed light on is that a lot of people live their lives in such a way, that &amp;ldquo;social distancing&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t pose such a disruption to their day to day. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I am &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt; with not having a massive circle of friends, and while a younger version of me would have said that utterly disingenuously, I don&amp;rsquo;t. I came to understand the hard way surrounding yourself with people, regardless of the quality of the character, is not a good thing. We are the average of the people we surround ourselves with after all. Taking that aside, the truth is most people piss me off, my social battery is reminiscent of a three-year-old iPad at this point. The fact is, it was not the lack of social contact that I saw a problem with over lockdown, it was the realisation that I simply do not leave my room a lot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So admittedly this post was going to be a summary of a hacker news thread I saw called &lt;code&gt;Ask HN: What is the best advice you received in 2022&lt;/code&gt;. I only recently joined HN, but it gives me a similar warm comfy feeling that old-school Reddit did. It encourages intelligent back-and-forth conversation, where having an unpopular opinion doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically mean some gremlin bans you from commenting again in &lt;code&gt;/r/whatever&lt;/code&gt;. In reality, I have only ever been banned from one subreddit, and that was before the CCP levels of over-moderation became commonplace, but that hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped me from watching the site (I once was a happy member of) devolve into the cesspit it is today. Despite this tangent, this post is also not about Reddit, more than one person has chronicled that site&amp;rsquo;s devolution far better than I ever could.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I often find it hard to pick my favourite film or even my top ten favourite films. I have spent the past few years trying to expose myself to the best that the media industry has to offer. I will say that despite all of what I have watched no film has had such a large impact on me, and how I view the world, as Trainspotting. Ironically enough I have never read the original book, despite my long-term intentions to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My goals for 2023</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made a lot of promises to myself of things I was going to do in 2023 - I overall have followed an interesting path over the past 3 years, and I do consider myself now to be entirely different to the person I was in 2020. I have hinted on this blog prior that I went to university, but have never gone into quite so much detail on my experience there - this blog is not going to be that tell-all, but I will say that I learnt to allot from university (none of it was even remotely related to economics, however). There does remain the fact however that there are parts of who I am that I want to improve, and I want to dedicate 2023 to that purpose&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to harden SSH - Basic guide</title>
      <link>https://eddiequinn.xyz/posts/2022/harden_ssh/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post (unlike my other two) is not going to be a ranty post about something that annoys me. This in truth is more of a reference guide on how to harden OpenSSH. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to do a massive paragraph on what is ssh, if you reading this you likely already know - however for background, ssh stands for secure shell, and is one of the most popular ways to administer Linux (and sometimes windows) servers. Because it is so popular, it is often the first point of call when a hacker is looking for an attack vector.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mfa Fatigue - The black sheep of the MFA family</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In September 2022 Uber, the most popular ride-sharing service was hacked. An 18-year-old used a combination of social engineering, MFA fatigue, and directory pivoting to stumble into unfettered access to Uber&amp;rsquo;s internal network. This is an allegory of oversight in the cybersecurity field. I am not going to spend ten minutes ranting about this hack, because it has had an overbearing amount of coverage over the past two weeks. I am however going to talk about one of the techniques the hacker used to gain access to the account, MFA fatigue&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Protonmail - A wolf in sheep&#39;s clothing</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is going to discuss the controversial issue of why does Protonmail not actually measure up to what it claims to be. This article is going to annoy a lot of people inside the alt-tech domain, and Iâm okay with this. This blog was never meant to be a place where I state popular opinions on things, it was always going to be a verbose and unapologetic collection of articles on subjects I find interesting. I am a customer of Protonmail and have been for many years, and I am likely to remain so for many years to come, but this does not mean that Protonmail does not deserve to be critiqued.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
