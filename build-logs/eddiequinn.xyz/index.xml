      <description>&lt;p&gt;As with all projects of mine, there is a list of things which I want to do with it when I find the time to do so. This is said list&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automate build process to occur daily -&lt;/strong&gt; So in its current iteration my site is built by running &lt;code&gt;hugo -t risotto&lt;/code&gt; and then committing any changes to the public submodule. It is then auto-built using GitHub pages. In an ideal world, this would all happen on a daily basis automatically, and this will be possible through the use of GitHub actions. I am however putting this on the back burner for now - The reason behind this is that as my homelab is built out further I eventually want to run a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jenkins.io/&#34;&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://about.gitea.com/&#34;&gt;GitTea&lt;/a&gt; server. Given this, I do not want to write out an automation file for GitHub when I will eventually have to write a separate one later on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set up TOR site -&lt;/strong&gt; I eventually want to set up my site so it runs as a TOR-Hidden-Service. Why? Because it&amp;rsquo;s cool. The actual catalyst for my wanting to do this was Network Chucks video &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CurcakgurRE&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I am however relucatant to do this until I have set up the automated build process. The reason behind this is that I would be able to use that to automatically pull the site files on the host.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set up a linktree page -&lt;/strong&gt; This is something I have wanted to do for a while, and for the longest time, I wanted to do it using an open-source solution like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/heysagnik/Linkees&#34;&gt;linktees&lt;/a&gt;. In reality, I do not have anything nearly as complex as this, just a page on my site showing all my links. I would however like to have it set up so it&amp;rsquo;s not just a series of hyperlinks - I can possibly use &lt;a href=&#34;https://simpleicons.org/&#34;&gt;SimpleIcons&lt;/a&gt; to do this. I&amp;rsquo;ll think about it. This &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; could present some issues for when I deploy a TOR site, as these links would likely lead to the clear net - for that reason, it&amp;rsquo;s important I put on a banner stating this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security.txt -&lt;/strong&gt; I might have one of these already, I doubt it though. One possible resource to do this in the future is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/davidsneighbour/hugo-modules/tree/main/modules/security&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>
