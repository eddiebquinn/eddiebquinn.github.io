        <p>So as with all of my hyperfixations, I think about all the things I want to add to my homelab. Some of the plans around all of these additions haven&rsquo;t been fully fleshed out, and therefore are not deserving (in their current form) of a whole section. However, I do want to write down what I want to add, and why I want to add them.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ansible and IAC -</strong> So one thing I have already noticed that will get old quickly is configuring servers. I mentioned in the DNS Server section that I think configuring basic hardening is something that there is zero excuse not to do. I don&rsquo;t want to let my laziness get in the way of my principles, and thus now is the time to implement &lsquo;Infrastructure as Code&rsquo;. Several of the YouTubers I follow recommend Ansible for this, namely NetworkChuck, Wolfgang, and Jeff Geerling. I will write more about this when the time comes for me to implement it, but this will allow me to automate a lot</li>
<li><strong>Uptime Kuma -</strong> As my home lab grows I want to be able to monitor all of the services that I am running. Uptime Kuma is one of the easiest ways to do this that I know of.</li>
<li><strong>Git server -</strong> I use GitHub as my portfolio, and because of that, I want to avoid cluttering it with things like the files that this website is run on. For that reason I ideally</li>
<li><strong>Certificate Authority -</strong> I will get into why I want to do this more at the time when I do it. To keep things simple however, it is mainly because I want to make sure that all my services communicate over HTTPS, and I don&rsquo;t want to make exceptions for their certificates on individual devices. Yes, I can do that dodgy thing with Cloudflare and subdomains, but frankly, I want my network infrastructure to be self-sufficient.</li>
<li><strong>PiKVM -</strong> I have a post I am writing where I go through the list of things I have saved in my RSS &ldquo;read later&rdquo; folder. One of the links was an LTT video on PiKVM. It made me realise I may benefit from having 1 (or 3) of these. One hooked up to my main pc, another given to my parents to allow me to remote onto their PC and help out from anywhere, and one that I can potentially use as a drop box to get remote access during pen-testing (although this would require some modifications to work). It&rsquo;s not strictly speaking part of my home lab, but if I was to ever upgrade to a server I would need something like this.</li>
