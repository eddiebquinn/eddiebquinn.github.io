Infrastructure • Automation • Long-form thinking

This is a personal technical blog where infrastructure experiments, operational workflows, and reflective essays live side by side.

I write about reproducible systems, automation, and the thinking that informs how I approach technology and work. Some posts are deep dives into tooling and infrastructure. Others explore the systems — technical or cultural — that shape how we operate.

## Focus

- - Reproducible infrastructure & automation
- - Declarative systems and build workflows
- - Operational discipline and MTTR reduction
- - Essays on technology and systems thinking

## What to Expect

Posts here are not tutorials or polished guides.  
They are logs of implementation, reflection, and iteration — written in public.
