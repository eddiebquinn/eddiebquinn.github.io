      <description>Hey there, been a while? Did you miss me? It&amp;rsquo;s cool, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t either.&#xA;So there has been a project I have wanted to do with my blog for some time, and I have finally gotten around to doing it. I touched on this in my blog post So… I Guess I’m Learning DevOps?, or at least the plans around it.&#xA;My current workflow involves manually rebuilding the site whenever I post something, but I want to automate it, so pushing to my blog-posts repo triggers an automatic build and deployment.</description>
