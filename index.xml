      <title>My Goals for 2024</title>
      <link>https://eddiequinn.xyz/posts/2023/dec/2024-goals/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the start of this year, I started it with a list of goals - At the start of the year, I did regular updates on these goals, and have tried to keep these as the year has gone. Given this year is coming to an end I would like to do a closing post on these goals and how they went, and posit some goals for 2024. I will say, that even though some of these goals were not achieved, having these at the back of my mind has been a good help in actually making sure I achieved something in 2023. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I did it, and I think this system was far more effective than my typical &amp;ldquo;I want to lose weight&amp;rdquo; New year&amp;rsquo;s resolution before this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Attempt 1 - Wireguard Ubuntu</title>
      <link>https://eddiequinn.xyz/build-logs/homelab/02-vpn-server/attempt1-wireguard-ubuntu/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So to make a long story short, I have my VPN server up and running using the confiration established in this post title. I do not feel proud of how this was achieved, however, as it feels like cheating. My initial plan, as I have gone over in a lot of depth, was to use Wireguard layered on top of OpenBSD. This quickly became complex, because I was having trouble just installing OpenBSD on the Pi. I fully intend to eventually implement this configuration, however, I needed to get A VPN server up and running this weekend and simply did not have time to troubleshoot the original plan. On top of this, there was a functionality that was missing in the original plan that this one covers, i.e. a web GUI. Eventually, I plan to upgrade to OpenBSD Wireguard, but for now, this works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I cannot spend too much time on this post because I have other things to do today.

As per usual I have made a dog&amp;rsquo;s ear over a very simple problem.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been studying for my Network+ for the last few months. In doing so I have learnt to appreciate the inner workings of networking infrastructure, and how the modern-day internet functions and came to be. Truly, just for you to be reading this page is nothing short of a miracle - There is an incredibly noisy world just out of the scope of our senses that most people will never get a chance to learn about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>6- Mvp</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;ve got to a point where I can call this MVP - It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean this is finished, however. This change while for the greater good has negatively affected my workflow, and one of the major goals of this project was to avoid just that. For that reason, I cannot consider this &amp;ldquo;finished&amp;rdquo;. Below is the list of things I still need to bring in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;auto-sign-script&#34;&gt;Auto-sign script&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So as mentioned in previous posts on this topic I needed to retire my old PGP key, as my private key was compromised - I have done this. I am still using Keybase as a keyserver, however, my private key is safely stored on my system, and I have zero intention of ever letting it touch the internet. This being said, when I switched over my keys I had to sign all my old posts. Due to some issues, I was running into with my automated pythonscript applying bad-signatures, I didn&amp;rsquo;t wind up using an automated solution. I signed all of my posts by hand - it was not fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some of you may remember earlier on in the year I went through a phase of wanting to sign my posts with PGP. This plan fell to the wayside fairly quickly and got &amp;ldquo;placed on the backburner&amp;rdquo; i.e. I will fix this when I figure out how. Well, after finding myself away from work for a week I have taken the time to figure this out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;taking-advantage-of-the-new-feature&#34;&gt;Taking advantage of the new feature&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before I get into how I did this I want to clarify how you can take advantage of this new feature. Every post now has an accompanying plaintext page showing the signature. An example of this is the section page for the signing posts project&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you pay attention to this site some of you may have noticed the inclusion of a new section of the site called build-logs. It essentially covers progress notes on various projects I am working on. One major project I am working on regarding this site is setting up automated PGP signing of the posts on it. I gave a brief explanation of how PGP works in one of the posts in that section, and I feel it gives a good and clear explanation of the concept of public key cryptography to a layman. I have however, for the longest time, wanted to do an in-depth explanation of how PGP works - this is not only because there seem to be very few non-academic resources on the subject, but also to bolster my understanding of the subject. This post is just that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As with all projects of mine, there is a list of things which I want to do with it when I find the time to do so. This is said list&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automate build process to occur daily -&lt;/strong&gt; So in its current iteration my site is built by running &lt;code&gt;hugo -t risotto&lt;/code&gt; and then committing any changes to the public submodule. It is then auto-built using GitHub pages. In an ideal world, this would all happen on a daily basis automatically, and this will be possible through the use of GitHub actions. I am however putting this on the back burner for now - The reason behind this is that as my homelab is built out further I eventually want to run a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.jenkins.io/&#34;&gt;Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://about.gitea.com/&#34;&gt;GitTea&lt;/a&gt; server. Given this, I do not want to write out an automation file for GitHub when I will eventually have to write a separate one later on.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set up TOR site -&lt;/strong&gt; I eventually want to set up my site so it runs as a TOR-Hidden-Service. Why? Because it&amp;rsquo;s cool. The actual catalyst for my wanting to do this was Network Chucks video &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CurcakgurRE&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I am however relucatant to do this until I have set up the automated build process. The reason behind this is that I would be able to use that to automatically pull the site files on the host.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set up a linktree page -&lt;/strong&gt; This is something I have wanted to do for a while, and for the longest time, I wanted to do it using an open-source solution like &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/heysagnik/Linkees&#34;&gt;linktees&lt;/a&gt;. In reality, I do not have anything nearly as complex as this, just a page on my site showing all my links. I would however like to have it set up so it&amp;rsquo;s not just a series of hyperlinks - I can possibly use &lt;a href=&#34;https://simpleicons.org/&#34;&gt;SimpleIcons&lt;/a&gt; to do this. I&amp;rsquo;ll think about it. This &lt;em&gt;possibly&lt;/em&gt; could present some issues for when I deploy a TOR site, as these links would likely lead to the clear net - for that reason, it&amp;rsquo;s important I put on a banner stating this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security.txt -&lt;/strong&gt; I might have one of these already, I doubt it though. One possible resource to do this in the future is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/davidsneighbour/hugo-modules/tree/main/modules/security&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Z - Services to Be Added</title>
      <link>https://eddiequinn.xyz/build-logs/homelab/z-services-to-be-added/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 16:12:32 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://eddiequinn.xyz/build-logs/homelab/z-services-to-be-added/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So as with all of my hyperfixations, I think about all the things I want to add to my homelab. Some of the plans around all of these additions haven&amp;rsquo;t been fully fleshed out, and therefore are not deserving (in their current form) of a whole section. However, I do want to write down what I want to add, and why I want to add them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ansible and IAC -&lt;/strong&gt; So one thing I have already noticed that will get old quickly is configuring servers. I mentioned in the DNS Server section that I think configuring basic hardening is something that there is zero excuse not to do. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to let my laziness get in the way of my principles, and thus now is the time to implement &amp;lsquo;Infrastructure as Code&amp;rsquo;. Several of the YouTubers I follow recommend Ansible for this, namely NetworkChuck, Wolfgang, and Jeff Geerling. I will write more about this when the time comes for me to implement it, but this will allow me to automate a lot&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uptime Kuma -&lt;/strong&gt; As my home lab grows I want to be able to monitor all of the services that I am running. Uptime Kuma is one of the easiest ways to do this that I know of.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Git server -&lt;/strong&gt; I use GitHub as my portfolio, and because of that, I want to avoid cluttering it with things like the files that this website is run on. For that reason I ideally&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certificate Authority -&lt;/strong&gt; I will get into why I want to do this more at the time when I do it. To keep things simple however, it is mainly because I want to make sure that all my services communicate over HTTPS, and I don&amp;rsquo;t want to make exceptions for their certificates on individual devices. Yes, I can do that dodgy thing with Cloudflare and subdomains, but frankly, I want my network infrastructure to be self-sufficient.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PiKVM -&lt;/strong&gt; I have a post I am writing where I go through the list of things I have saved in my RSS &amp;ldquo;read later&amp;rdquo; folder. One of the links was an LTT video on PiKVM. It made me realise I may benefit from having 1 (or 3) of these. One hooked up to my main pc, another given to my parents to allow me to remote onto their PC and help out from anywhere, and one that I can potentially use as a drop box to get remote access during pen-testing (although this would require some modifications to work). It&amp;rsquo;s not strictly speaking part of my home lab, but if I was to ever upgrade to a server I would need something like this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had heard about &lt;a href=&#34;https://pi-hole.net/&#34;&gt;Pi-Hole&lt;/a&gt; years ago on a Linus Tech Tips video about it (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4&#34;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;). Since that point I have wanted to implement it, however, my first attempt miserably failed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I want to take this moment to say that BT is a terrible ISP, and if you are able to leave it then you should. Their provided routers are locked down to a degree that Apple would the zealous of, and their predatory business model is that of &amp;ldquo;keep upselling vulnerable customers things they don&amp;rsquo;t need, so if they ever do want to leave they would have to give up all the add ons&amp;rdquo;. The original issue stemmed from the fact that their provided router does not allow you to set a custom DNS server, and this was fairly easily fixed just by buying 3rd party router (currently I use the TP-Link AX5400). The next issue comes from the fact that BT does not allow you to put their router into bridge mode, so currently, my new router is plugged into their router, which is plugged into the demarcation port on the wall. This does not present an issue currently, but I know it will when it comes to when I want to set up wireguard (I&amp;rsquo;ll explain why in that section).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The plan is to build a collection of raspberry-pi&amp;rsquo;s held in a Pi-Cluster case, all of which run a dedicated service. The reason I choose this method is for two key reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I already have a couple of raspberry pi&amp;rsquo;s lying around my house, and could no longer justify &amp;ldquo;saving up for a server&amp;rdquo;. If you are familiar with the concept of bikeshedding, this is definitely what I have been doing - I needed to just start at MVP, and then build up to an ideal, and then waste building that ideal.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;When I do eventually get a server, the pi&amp;rsquo;s can be turned into a bare-metal K3S cluster.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In its first form, the pis will be powered by an extension lead, however, I will change it later on. I plan to install a PoE hat onto all of the pi&amp;rsquo;s and purchase a separate PoE switch to power them all from. The main reason I want to do this is to cut down on the amount of plugs into my extension lead, but I am sure there are other benefits of doing this that I have missed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Where Do Governments Derive Their Right to Rule</title>
      <link>https://eddiequinn.xyz/posts/2023/oct/where-do-goverments-derive-their-right-to-rule/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I am a libertarian - I hold opinions that are controversial in a traditional sense, but when you boil them down to their core sentiments, most people share. An example of this, I feel that gun ownership should be liberalised. The typical first reaction to this is &amp;ldquo;Oh so you don&amp;rsquo;t care at all about kids being murdered?&amp;rdquo;, which can be translated to &amp;ldquo;I disagree with your statement&amp;rdquo;. However, when I express my reasoning behind it, most people come to understand that the pro/anti-gun argument is a tad more complex than &amp;ldquo;gun kills person, and kil is bad&amp;rdquo;. They may not agree with my point, but that isn&amp;rsquo;t what is important. This is not the post for this argument, but my point is that most people&amp;rsquo;s relationship with politics is not nearly as nuanced as they think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;&#xA;Hash: SHA256&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I am a libertarian - I hold opinions that are controversial in a traditional sense, but when you boil them down to their core sentiments, most people share. An example of this, I feel that gun ownership should be liberalised. The typical first reaction to this is &amp;ldquo;Oh so you don&amp;rsquo;t care at all about kids being murdered?&amp;rdquo;, which can be translated to &amp;ldquo;I disagree with your statement&amp;rdquo;. However, when I express my reasoning behind it, most people come to understand that the pro/anti-gun argument is a tad more complex than &amp;ldquo;gun kills person, and kil is bad&amp;rdquo;. They may not agree with my point, but that isn&amp;rsquo;t what is important. This is not the post for this argument, but my point is that most people&amp;rsquo;s relationship with politics is not nearly as nuanced as they think.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The reason I am writing this note is that I am essentially declaring bankruptcy on my ability to prepare and pack for a trip with no external workflow. If you ever think you do not need this list Ed, I would like to remind you of the following events&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lake district trip -&lt;/strong&gt; Remember that time you forgot your braces and had to hold your trousers up for two weeks? I do&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amsterdam trip -&lt;/strong&gt; Remember how you have no good way to charge multiple devices at once? I do&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HCCPP 2023 -&lt;/strong&gt; Remember how you messed this one up and forgot soap, charging facilities, a padlock, a sewing kit, etc.? I do&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ed - this is for your good. This shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be that hard, you love checklists?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite anticipate writing about this particular post. It started as me wanting to write down a list of everything I should bring with me when I travel for future reference. I however have found myself in a spot where I am quite taken aback by an event, and feel for the sake of my future self I need to write down my current thoughts to reflect on at some point.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about Unix-based operating systems is how customisable they are. I originally came to Linux as a flex on my other nerdy friends, however, I stayed because for the first time in my life my machine was &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt;. Most Windows users wouldn&amp;rsquo;t appreciate this, some Linux users may not even - however there is a subset of Linux users who do understand this. &lt;code&gt;ext4&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;btrfs&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sddm&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;ly&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gnome&lt;/code&gt;/&lt;code&gt;kde&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;BSPWM&lt;/code&gt;. The modularity of the system allows you to take various things you find interesting and combine them into a system that you have curated. The issue with this, as it is an issue, is that when it comes to installing my system on a new PC I suddenly find myself having to drag out old YouTube videos, blog posts, and mailing lists so I can reproduce what I have on my other machines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I tried to write a post yesterday about this topic, but it became a rambly mess about how I want to start a photography project. I have changed a lot since 2020, and at points, I am still trying to decide if it is for the better or the worse. In one way, I have become more self-reliant and grown up a lot. In another way, I have become more cynical and mistrusting of those around me. My therapist would say that when people get hurt they adopt defense mechanisms to prevent it from happening again. Post-breakup with a certain girl I became very determined not to ever be in the position I was in again. That was a lost and depressed skin suit of a boy who had just been emotionally abused for close to six months. I changed a lot because of that, for the first time in my life I began to take responsibility for my happiness. For the first time in my life, I told people no. For the first time in my life, I moved away from larping &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t care what other people think of me&amp;rdquo; and lived it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I have mentioned before how I think reddit, inspite of my fond memories of it during the 2010&amp;rsquo;s, is a case study of everything wrong with the modern day internet. When i mentioned this before I said one day I would explain why I feel this, and lo-and-behold here we are.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In January of 2023, I went to Amsterdam with a friend - Following my coming back I was going to make a post on the total sensory overload that I experienced there but I never got around to it. I had always wanted to go to Amsterdam, and now I have gone I fully intend to go back before the year is out. This post is not me chronicling that adventure, the truth is that spending two days smoking weed with my Dutch friend is just not that interesting of a story. On the train journey over the person I was traveling with introduced me to an app called &amp;ldquo;be you&amp;rdquo;. To the best of my knowledge, the point of the app is that at a random point in the day, you will be prompted to take a photo of yourself or something you are doing, and this doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you a chance to curate your life. I think in theory it&amp;rsquo;s meant to break you away from presenting the &amp;ldquo;perfect Instagram life&amp;rdquo; that you lead. My friend seemed proud of this app and what she was doing with it, I on the other hand was reminded of Ted Kasycnski.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE&amp;mdash;&amp;ndash;&#xA;Hash: SHA256&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have mentioned my job on this blog a couple of times. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into that much detail about it - This has very little to do with any rules and regulations on my job itself, it is more related to I have found it to be best practice not to discuss these things online. That being said my continuous professional development and my job itself exist in different domains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I originally wrote this article I was going to go on a massive schpeel about the question of &amp;ldquo;what is art?&amp;rdquo; The questions itself has very little to do with the subject matter of this post, which is why I cut it out. That being said I do not want to discount what I wrote, that being that art itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t have rigid borders of what does and does not fall into the category. It instead holds characteristics, and these characteristics are loose enough that almost anything can be shoehorned into that definition. The main characteristic is that art invokes a response, and this response may be positive or negative. I will one day do a post where I discuss my brief stint working as a security guard in a modern art museum, but today I am going to discuss Tenet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the original lockdown, I had just gotten out of what was hopefully the worst relationship of my life. I won&amp;rsquo;t explain why this relationship was so bad, those who know - she has caused enough damage and I do not plan to invite anymore. Post break up I had what I think alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity when all of the comforts fall away and you find yourself at rock bottom. I would write an unpublished post a year after this called &amp;ldquo;the view from halfway down&amp;rdquo;, describing how after a year of self-improvement my foundations cracked and all my progress fell apart. The view from halfway down was a good case study in the sentiment that the hind-site is 20 20. While I did lose weight, conquer many demons, and become a better person overall,  I only manifested these changes due to a melancholic fury at my ex-girlfriend. I am glad I failed because it means I have finally moved on&amp;hellip; I am however still trying to get back to where I was.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is a tad overdue, a timeline of illness to birthday back to illness is to blame for that. I am very much playing catch-up now, intending to publish enough posts to make up for last month&amp;rsquo;s backlog, and this month&amp;rsquo;s quota.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall February was &lt;em&gt;somewhat&lt;/em&gt; of a success. I fell behind in regards to publishing blog posts and still haven&amp;rsquo;t made successful headway with the book&amp;rsquo;s goals, however in regards to my goals of being healthier and paying off my overdraft I have made progress.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I go through phases where I become obsessed with things for a couple of weeks, burn out, and then move on to something else. This cycle continues until a point where I wind up back to being in a fleeting-obsessive state about. The theory behind it, or at least the one that I have always subscribed to is that autistic people become obsessed with this in an attempt to understand it better, and in effect understand the world better. Regardless of the reasons behind, it this is part of who I am.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Diet Drinks are Still Bad</title>
      <link>https://eddiequinn.xyz/posts/2023/feb/diet-drinks-still-bad/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2023 00:56:10 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a recent post, I mentioned that as part of my trying move towards achieving my 2023 goal of &amp;ldquo;be healthier&amp;rdquo; I was going to quit energy drinks. There are multiple reasons for this, many of which I am going into detail in this post. What I did not quite anticipate is the human mind&amp;rsquo;s ability to move towards something just as bad when a crutch is taken away.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;energy-drinks-cigarettes-and-car-parks&#34;&gt;Energy drinks, cigarettes, and car-parks&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was emo, and arguably still am based on my Spotify Libary. Growing up in the 2010s as an emo was a very odd experience. I think it is best personified by a Facebook post I read once that said &amp;ldquo;the girls look like boys, the boys look like girls, and all of them don&amp;rsquo;t seem to understand why they are sexually confused&amp;rdquo;. Looking back it wasn&amp;rsquo;t counterculture, nor was it rebellious in any way - It was just cringe. From the incessant Facebook posts going &lt;code&gt;RAWR - Dat means I wub woo in dinosaur&lt;/code&gt; or the ongoing feud between BVB fans and metal heads that didn&amp;rsquo;t consider it &amp;ldquo;real metal&amp;rdquo;, the whole 7-year epoch for me was borderline ridiculous. There are some experiences I have had where if I was allowed to go back I would still do it, just for the experience. This is not one of them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was in sixth form one of the first things I was taught in economics is the law of diminishing marginal returns. LDMR states that as the quantity of a variable input used in production increases, while all other inputs are held constant, the marginal output of that input will eventually decrease. The common way to explain this is with the guns-and-butter framework, which refers to the trade-off between two competing priorities in an economy: military spending (represented by &amp;ldquo;guns&amp;rdquo;) and consumer goods spending (represented by &amp;ldquo;butter&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Five days into the second month and I don&amp;rsquo;t appear to have successfully sat down to write a blog post - I must be slacking. This post is more of a self-check-in, to make sure that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to stick to the goals that I set for myself in the new year. It probably is not going to be as thought-provoking as other posts given that context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;goal-1-im-going-to-write-more&#34;&gt;Goal 1) Im going to write more&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This goal is one of those which I want to say was a resounding success - Not only did I write the number of posts I needed to write for that month, I enjoyed it. I have always enjoyed writing, and I have always intended to kick off with blogging  - however intending is akin to &amp;ldquo;would of, should of, could of&amp;rdquo;. I somewhat think the &amp;ldquo;100daysofoffload&amp;rdquo; challenge was the kick up the backside I needed to start writing regularly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am quite a cynical person in general. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is an unfair statement for me to say that I look at most things in life with an air of caution. This is not out of some unfounded paranoia of the world around me, conspiracy theories are fun but most are just fun and games. The thing is though when you look slightly below the surface level on most things you will understand the world is a very ugly place. Despite my love of technology, I have always approached the concept of artificial intelligence with an atmosphere of discontent. Perhaps it is due to thought experiments like Rokos Basilisk or the disturbing imagery of &amp;ldquo;I have no mouth but I must scream&amp;rdquo;. I am reluctant to say AI is the biggest threat to humanity in our current epoch, but I am also unwilling to write off that statement as total fiction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am reaching an odd point in life, one which I feel many people reach, where I have many many projects I want to work on and very little time to actually dedicate to them. This seems idiotic to actually write a post about, but when you come to accept that very few people actually read your blog, then it becomes more of a self-monologue than a communication to your peers. I am writing this for myself to organise my thoughts around this topic. I read an article earlier last year about the act of &amp;lsquo;selfish writing&amp;rsquo;, and how writing with the intent of entertaining others and writing with the intent of entertaining yourself do not always go hand in hand. I could write a post with the intent to inform or describe how to harden an SSH server, and I have in the past. However, thousands of others do the same. I do not personally want to write that, and the community does not need another tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After my recent stint of watching Hunting Hitler, I have found myself in that melancholy state that many do after finishing a good series, riddled with the question &amp;ldquo;what will I use to distract myself from actual tasks now&amp;rdquo;. After watching several case studies of mediocrity that occupy the current low-attention-span-cultural-zeitgeist I found the new Netflix series &amp;ldquo;The Playlist&amp;rdquo;. I am only two episodes in, but from my basic understanding It chronicles the creation of Spotify from multiple points of view. What I find interesting is that The Pirate Bay(TPB) plays a central role in the creation of Spotify, what I find more interesting is the series not wanting to chronicle the point of view of the &amp;ldquo;pirates&amp;rdquo; that occupied the space then. This makes sense because fundamentally the pirates didn&amp;rsquo;t play a direct part in the creation of Spotify, they were more of a competitor than anything. Watching this did take me back however to the undying advocacy for freedom of information that torrenting brought on during my time in this period. I was a pirate back then. While I try to be a functioning member of society currently, (predominately because of the groundwork laid by platforms like Spotify), I can&amp;rsquo;t help but notice the entertainment industry making many of the same mistakes that lead to the widespread adoption of TPB back then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The oddly freeing experience of studying in Starbucks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think the lockdown taught a lot of people about themselves. The main thing it shed light on is that a lot of people live their lives in such a way, that &amp;ldquo;social distancing&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t pose such a disruption to their day to day. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I am &lt;em&gt;okay&lt;/em&gt; with not having a massive circle of friends, and while a younger version of me would have said that utterly disingenuously, I don&amp;rsquo;t. I came to understand the hard way surrounding yourself with people, regardless of the quality of the character, is not a good thing. We are the average of the people we surround ourselves with after all. Taking that aside, the truth is most people piss me off, my social battery is reminiscent of a three-year-old iPad at this point. The fact is, it was not the lack of social contact that I saw a problem with over lockdown, it was the realisation that I simply do not leave my room a lot.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A post where I talk about my weight</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So admittedly this post was going to be a summary of a hacker news thread I saw called &lt;code&gt;Ask HN: What is the best advice you received in 2022&lt;/code&gt;. I only recently joined HN, but it gives me a similar warm comfy feeling that old-school Reddit did. It encourages intelligent back-and-forth conversation, where having an unpopular opinion doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically mean some gremlin bans you from commenting again in &lt;code&gt;/r/whatever&lt;/code&gt;. In reality, I have only ever been banned from one subreddit, and that was before the CCP levels of over-moderation became commonplace, but that hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped me from watching the site (I once was a happy member of) devolve into the cesspit it is today. Despite this tangent, this post is also not about Reddit, more than one person has chronicled that site&amp;rsquo;s devolution far better than I ever could.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I often find it hard to pick my favourite film or even my top ten favourite films. I have spent the past few years trying to expose myself to the best that the media industry has to offer. I will say that despite all of what I have watched no film has had such a large impact on me, and how I view the world, as Trainspotting. Ironically enough I have never read the original book, despite my long-term intentions to do so.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made a lot of promises to myself of things I was going to do in 2023 - I overall have followed an interesting path over the past 3 years, and I do consider myself now to be entirely different to the person I was in 2020. I have hinted on this blog prior that I went to university, but have never gone into quite so much detail on my experience there - this blog is not going to be that tell-all, but I will say that I learnt to allot from university (none of it was even remotely related to economics, however). There does remain the fact however that there are parts of who I am that I want to improve, and I want to dedicate 2023 to that purpose&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to harden SSH - Basic guide</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post (unlike my other two) is not going to be a ranty post about something that annoys me. This in truth is more of a reference guide on how to harden OpenSSH. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to do a massive paragraph on what is ssh, if you reading this you likely already know - however for background, ssh stands for secure shell, and is one of the most popular ways to administer Linux (and sometimes windows) servers. Because it is so popular, it is often the first point of call when a hacker is looking for an attack vector.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mfa Fatigue - The black sheep of the MFA family</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In September 2022 Uber, the most popular ride-sharing service was hacked. An 18-year-old used a combination of social engineering, MFA fatigue, and directory pivoting to stumble into unfettered access to Uber&amp;rsquo;s internal network. This is an allegory of oversight in the cybersecurity field. I am not going to spend ten minutes ranting about this hack, because it has had an overbearing amount of coverage over the past two weeks. I am however going to talk about one of the techniques the hacker used to gain access to the account, MFA fatigue&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article is going to discuss the controversial issue of why does Protonmail not actually measure up to what it claims to be. This article is going to annoy a lot of people inside the alt-tech domain, and Iâm okay with this. This blog was never meant to be a place where I state popular opinions on things, it was always going to be a verbose and unapologetic collection of articles on subjects I find interesting. I am a customer of Protonmail and have been for many years, and I am likely to remain so for many years to come, but this does not mean that Protonmail does not deserve to be critiqued.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is a bit of a joke that I play on many people that when they say &amp;ldquo;How are you&amp;rdquo; I will respond with &amp;ldquo;I am not dead&amp;rdquo;. Some laugh it off, some say it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a dismal thing to say, and some respond with &amp;ldquo;same&amp;rdquo;. I have always found it very interesting to see how others respond to this. I often can tell how well I will get on with them based entirely on the response. In any case, given it has been more than a year since my last post I feel the need to say that I am not dead.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
