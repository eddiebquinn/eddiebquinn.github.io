      <title>Ownership Is a Firmware Problem</title>

      <description>I am not a car guy - I know a little bit about cars, and have a limited understanding of what people are doing when they install mods to their cars, but I have never delved into this arcane trade myself. I would like to one day. I saw an interesting video a couple of months ago where someone applied the Unix philosophy, that code should do one job and do it well, to his personal life.</description>

      <description>Posting three times in a month is rare for me, though lightning does tend to favour certain ground. I began writing a post the other day about being perpetually burned out, and how I sit between a proverbial rock and a hard place - flitting between taking on polylithic tasks with competence and falling asleep at my desk. Self-regulating was never my strong suit, and thus I have found myself living and thriving in this peripatetic aether, much to the dismay of my neurotypical colleagues.</description>

      <description>I can probably count on both hands how many times in my life I have stayed in a hotel; I can count on a single hand how many times I have stayed in one alone. It just wasn&amp;rsquo;t something that my family did growing up, we certainly went on holiday but just not in hotels. So as I checked out of the Holiday Inn Express my work was booked for me at 3am, I was hit by the comment &amp;ldquo;do you ever sleep&amp;rdquo; by the night manager.</description>

      <description>Hey, been a while&amp;hellip; as usual. This is very much thrown together as a post, but I wanted to document the completion of two pretty big projects. I have finally deployed a K3S cluster in my homelab, and I have successfully moved from Arch to NixOS.&#xA;Warning: This is not a tutorial or guide, please run the commands in this post at your own risk.&#xA;I use Nix BTW I finally have moved from using Arch Linux as my OS of choice to running NixOS.</description>

      <description>Hey there, been a while? Did you miss me? It&amp;rsquo;s cool, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t either.&#xA;So there has been a project I have wanted to do with my blog for some time, and I have finally gotten around to doing it. I touched on this in my blog post So… I Guess I’m Learning DevOps?, or at least the plans around it.&#xA;My current workflow involves manually rebuilding the site whenever I post something, but I want to automate it, so pushing to my blog-posts repo triggers an automatic build and deployment.</description>

      <description>As promised, another post (whoopie).&#xA;My blog has needed a bit of TLC for a while. Some of these are backend issues related to the build process and some of these are front end issues. The main one you will notice is that there is no longer an annoying $echo $LANG line at the bottom of every post. This was an artifact of the theme I&amp;rsquo;m using, fairly easily fixed by setting a site-specific version of the lang.</description>

      <description>It is a bit of a joke that I play on many people that when they say &amp;ldquo;How are you&amp;rdquo; I will respond with &amp;ldquo;I am not dead&amp;rdquo;. Some laugh it off, some say it&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a dismal thing to say, and some respond with &amp;ldquo;same&amp;rdquo;. I have always found it very interesting to see how others respond to this. I often can tell how well I will get on with them based entirely on the response.</description>

      <title>Attempt 1 - Wireguard Ubuntu</title>

      <description>So to make a long story short, I have my VPN server up and running using the confiration established in this post title. I do not feel proud of how this was achieved, however, as it feels like cheating. My initial plan, as I have gone over in a lot of depth, was to use Wireguard layered on top of OpenBSD. This quickly became complex, because I was having trouble just installing OpenBSD on the Pi.</description>

      <description>At the start of this year, I started it with a list of goals - At the start of the year, I did regular updates on these goals, and have tried to keep these as the year has gone. Given this year is coming to an end I would like to do a closing post on these goals and how they went, and posit some goals for 2024. I will say, that even though some of these goals were not achieved, having these at the back of my mind has been a good help in actually making sure I achieved something in 2023.</description>

      <description>I cannot spend too much time on this post because I have other things to do today. I have found possible solutions to all of the problems I mentioned in the previous post. As per usual I have made a dog&amp;rsquo;s ear over a very simple problem. I was however along the right lines with my previous idea of having an auto-sign script&#xA;The issues The way I see it there are three key issues</description>

      <description>I have been studying for my Network+ for the last few months. In doing so I have learnt to appreciate the inner workings of networking infrastructure, and how the modern-day internet functions and came to be. Truly, just for you to be reading this page is nothing short of a miracle - There is an incredibly noisy world just out of the scope of our senses that most people will never get a chance to learn about.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve got to a point where I can call this MVP - It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean this is finished, however. This change while for the greater good has negatively affected my workflow, and one of the major goals of this project was to avoid just that. For that reason, I cannot consider this &amp;ldquo;finished&amp;rdquo;. Below is the list of things I still need to bring in.&#xA;Auto-sign script So as mentioned in previous posts on this topic I needed to retire my old PGP key, as my private key was compromised - I have done this.</description>

      <description>Some of you may remember earlier on in the year I went through a phase of wanting to sign my posts with PGP. This plan fell to the wayside fairly quickly and got &amp;ldquo;placed on the backburner&amp;rdquo; i.e. I will fix this when I figure out how. Well, after finding myself away from work for a week I have taken the time to figure this out.&#xA;Taking advantage of the new feature Before I get into how I did this I want to clarify how you can take advantage of this new feature.</description>

      <description>My friend has an API that if called will return a picture of an anime girl, and will return a new one every 24 hours (I think that&amp;rsquo;s how it works, truthfully I&amp;rsquo;ve never curl&amp;rsquo;d it). Thinking about that combined with a rant Luke Smith once made about fixing pull requests on his GitHub, I wish there was an API I could call to give me a random picture of a Pink Wojack every 24 hours.</description>

      <description>If you pay attention to this site some of you may have noticed the inclusion of a new section of the site called build-logs. It essentially covers progress notes on various projects I am working on. One major project I am working on regarding this site is setting up automated PGP signing of the posts on it. I gave a brief explanation of how PGP works in one of the posts in that section, and I feel it gives a good and clear explanation of the concept of public key cryptography to a layman.</description>

      <description>As with all projects of mine, there is a list of things which I want to do with it when I find the time to do so. This is said list&#xA;Automate build process to occur daily - So in its current iteration my site is built by running hugo -t risotto and then committing any changes to the public submodule. It is then auto-built using GitHub pages. In an ideal world, this would all happen on a daily basis automatically, and this will be possible through the use of GitHub actions.</description>

      <description>So after writing he previous post on this matter I came to two conclsions&#xA;This website, and this induvidual project, requires its own build log - This was changed. The commit hashes are listed below site commit: 1503286ff0b39d3f502a70373e803ec0b381940d sigs commit: 507310741ac6370d93f8b2e72f343456c81f7de1 I am overcomplicating this Hugo, unsuprisingly, has a features within it which solve every issue which I am trying to fix myself.&#xA;Custom Output Formats From digging around stack overflow and several carefully worded messages to our favourite dimwitted genius (chat gpt) i came across this page.</description>

      <title>3- Revisiting My Encryption Problem</title>

      <description>This was originally a blog post It may read differently from other build logs for that reason Earlier on this year I went down a strange rabbit hole on how I want to sign my posts using my GPG public key. In the end, I gave up because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a way to automate this, and at the time I blamed this on some limitations with Hugo. I now of course am walking that back, as theoretically it is perfectly possible.</description>

      <description>The plan is to build a collection of raspberry-pi&amp;rsquo;s held in a Pi-Cluster case, all of which run a dedicated service. The reason I choose this method is for two key reasons:&#xA;I already have a couple of raspberry pi&amp;rsquo;s lying around my house, and could no longer justify &amp;ldquo;saving up for a server&amp;rdquo;. If you are familiar with the concept of bikeshedding, this is definitely what I have been doing - I needed to just start at MVP, and then build up to an ideal, and then waste building that ideal.</description>

      <description>I had heard about Pi-Hole years ago on a Linus Tech Tips video about it (click here). Since that point I have wanted to implement it, however, my first attempt miserably failed.&#xA;I want to take this moment to say that BT is a terrible ISP, and if you are able to leave it then you should. Their provided routers are locked down to a degree that Apple would the zealous of, and their predatory business model is that of &amp;ldquo;keep upselling vulnerable customers things they don&amp;rsquo;t need, so if they ever do want to leave they would have to give up all the add ons&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>So as with all of my hyperfixations, I think about all the things I want to add to my homelab. Some of the plans around all of these additions haven&amp;rsquo;t been fully fleshed out, and therefore are not deserving (in their current form) of a whole section. However, I do want to write down what I want to add, and why I want to add them.&#xA;Ansible and IAC - So one thing I have already noticed that will get old quickly is configuring servers.</description>

      <description>So I am a libertarian - I hold opinions that are controversial in a traditional sense, but when you boil them down to their core sentiments, most people share. An example of this, I feel that gun ownership should be liberalised. The typical first reaction to this is &amp;ldquo;Oh so you don&amp;rsquo;t care at all about kids being murdered?&amp;rdquo;, which can be translated to &amp;ldquo;I disagree with your statement&amp;rdquo;. However, when I express my reasoning behind it, most people come to understand that the pro/anti-gun argument is a tad more complex than &amp;ldquo;gun kills person, and kil is bad&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>I tried to write a post yesterday about this topic, but it became a rambly mess about how I want to start a photography project. I have changed a lot since 2020, and at points, I am still trying to decide if it is for the better or the worse. In one way, I have become more self-reliant and grown up a lot. In another way, I have become more cynical and mistrusting of those around me.</description>

I have mentioned before how I think reddit, inspite of my fond memories of it during the 2010&amp;rsquo;s, is a case study of everything wrong with the modern day internet.</description>

      <description>When I was in secondary school at some point a realisation hit me, this realisation as time has gone on I have discovered is only a partial truth. Relying on this assumption on a general basis to make sense of human behavior is not an effective way to do it on general basis, but it can be an effective model to understand some of it. The assumption is as such:</description>

      <description>In January of 2023, I went to Amsterdam with a friend - Following my coming back I was going to make a post on the total sensory overload that I experienced there but I never got around to it. I had always wanted to go to Amsterdam, and now I have gone I fully intend to go back before the year is out. This post is not me chronicling that adventure, the truth is that spending two days smoking weed with my Dutch friend is just not that interesting of a story.</description>

      <description>This was originally a blog post It may read differently from other build logs for that reason Hey, been a while&#xA;I won&amp;rsquo;t waste my time explaining where I have been - the truth is very few people read this blog and those that do know that I have been fairly busy for the past month. I am attempting to get back into the swing of things, but to make an incredibly long story short I am currently coming over a pretty hard burnout.</description>

      <description>I have mentioned my job on this blog a couple of times. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to get into that much detail about it - This has very little to do with any rules and regulations on my job itself, it is more related to I have found it to be best practice not to discuss these things online. That being said my continuous professional development and my job itself exist in different domains.</description>

      <description>When I originally wrote this article I was going to go on a massive schpeel about the question of &amp;ldquo;what is art?&amp;rdquo; The questions itself has very little to do with the subject matter of this post, which is why I cut it out. That being said I do not want to discount what I wrote, that being that art itself doesn&amp;rsquo;t have rigid borders of what does and does not fall into the category.</description>

      <description>During the original lockdown, I had just gotten out of what was hopefully the worst relationship of my life. I won&amp;rsquo;t explain why this relationship was so bad, those who know - she has caused enough damage and I do not plan to invite anymore. Post break up I had what I think alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity when all of the comforts fall away and you find yourself at rock bottom.</description>

      <description>This post is a tad overdue, a timeline of illness to birthday back to illness is to blame for that. I am very much playing catch-up now, intending to publish enough posts to make up for last month&amp;rsquo;s backlog, and this month&amp;rsquo;s quota.&#xA;Overall February was somewhat of a success. I fell behind in regards to publishing blog posts and still haven&amp;rsquo;t made successful headway with the book&amp;rsquo;s goals, however in regards to my goals of being healthier and paying off my overdraft I have made progress.</description>

      <description>I go through phases where I become obsessed with things for a couple of weeks, burn out, and then move on to something else. This cycle continues until a point where I wind up back to being in a fleeting-obsessive state about. The theory behind it, or at least the one that I have always subscribed to is that autistic people become obsessed with this in an attempt to understand it better, and in effect understand the world better.</description>

      <description>In a recent post, I mentioned that as part of my trying move towards achieving my 2023 goal of &amp;ldquo;be healthier&amp;rdquo; I was going to quit energy drinks. There are multiple reasons for this, many of which I am going into detail in this post. What I did not quite anticipate is the human mind&amp;rsquo;s ability to move towards something just as bad when a crutch is taken away.&#xA;Energy drinks, cigarettes, and car-parks I was emo, and arguably still am based on my Spotify Libary.</description>

      <description>When I was in sixth form one of the first things I was taught in economics is the law of diminishing marginal returns. LDMR states that as the quantity of a variable input used in production increases, while all other inputs are held constant, the marginal output of that input will eventually decrease. The common way to explain this is with the guns-and-butter framework, which refers to the trade-off between two competing priorities in an economy: military spending (represented by &amp;ldquo;guns&amp;rdquo;) and consumer goods spending (represented by &amp;ldquo;butter&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <description>Five days into the second month and I don&amp;rsquo;t appear to have successfully sat down to write a blog post - I must be slacking. This post is more of a self-check-in, to make sure that I&amp;rsquo;m trying to stick to the goals that I set for myself in the new year. It probably is not going to be as thought-provoking as other posts given that context.&#xA;Goal 1) Im going to write more This goal is one of those which I want to say was a resounding success - Not only did I write the number of posts I needed to write for that month, I enjoyed it.</description>

      <description>I am quite a cynical person in general. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is an unfair statement for me to say that I look at most things in life with an air of caution. This is not out of some unfounded paranoia of the world around me, conspiracy theories are fun but most are just fun and games. The thing is though when you look slightly below the surface level on most things you will understand the world is a very ugly place.</description>

      <description>I am reaching an odd point in life, one which I feel many people reach, where I have many many projects I want to work on and very little time to actually dedicate to them. This seems idiotic to actually write a post about, but when you come to accept that very few people actually read your blog, then it becomes more of a self-monologue than a communication to your peers.</description>

      <description>After my recent stint of watching Hunting Hitler, I have found myself in that melancholy state that many do after finishing a good series, riddled with the question &amp;ldquo;what will I use to distract myself from actual tasks now&amp;rdquo;. After watching several case studies of mediocrity that occupy the current low-attention-span-cultural-zeitgeist I found the new Netflix series &amp;ldquo;The Playlist&amp;rdquo;. I am only two episodes in, but from my basic understanding It chronicles the creation of Spotify from multiple points of view.</description>

      <description>I think the lockdown taught a lot of people about themselves. The main thing it shed light on is that a lot of people live their lives in such a way, that &amp;ldquo;social distancing&amp;rdquo; didn&amp;rsquo;t pose such a disruption to their day to day. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I am okay with not having a massive circle of friends, and while a younger version of me would have said that utterly disingenuously, I don&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>So admittedly this post was going to be a summary of a hacker news thread I saw called Ask HN: What is the best advice you received in 2022. I only recently joined HN, but it gives me a similar warm comfy feeling that old-school Reddit did. It encourages intelligent back-and-forth conversation, where having an unpopular opinion doesn&amp;rsquo;t automatically mean some gremlin bans you from commenting again in /r/whatever. In reality, I have only ever been banned from one subreddit, and that was before the CCP levels of over-moderation became commonplace, but that hasn&amp;rsquo;t stopped me from watching the site (I once was a happy member of) devolve into the cesspit it is today.</description>

      <description>I often find it hard to pick my favourite film or even my top ten favourite films. I have spent the past few years trying to expose myself to the best that the media industry has to offer. I will say that despite all of what I have watched no film has had such a large impact on me, and how I view the world, as Trainspotting. Ironically enough I have never read the original book, despite my long-term intentions to do so.</description>

      <description>I made a lot of promises to myself of things I was going to do in 2023 - I overall have followed an interesting path over the past 3 years, and I do consider myself now to be entirely different to the person I was in 2020. I have hinted on this blog prior that I went to university, but have never gone into quite so much detail on my experience there - this blog is not going to be that tell-all, but I will say that I learnt to allot from university (none of it was even remotely related to economics, however).</description>

      <description>This post (unlike my other two) is not going to be a ranty post about something that annoys me. This in truth is more of a reference guide on how to harden OpenSSH. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to do a massive paragraph on what is ssh, if you reading this you likely already know - however for background, ssh stands for secure shell, and is one of the most popular ways to administer Linux (and sometimes windows) servers.</description>

      <description>In September 2022 Uber, the most popular ride-sharing service was hacked. An 18-year-old used a combination of social engineering, MFA fatigue, and directory pivoting to stumble into unfettered access to Uber&amp;rsquo;s internal network. This is an allegory of oversight in the cybersecurity field. I am not going to spend ten minutes ranting about this hack, because it has had an overbearing amount of coverage over the past two weeks. I am however going to talk about one of the techniques the hacker used to gain access to the account, MFA fatigue</description>

This article is going to annoy a lot of people inside the alt-tech domain, and Iâm okay with this. This blog was never meant to be a place where I state popular opinions on things, it was always going to be a verbose and unapologetic collection of articles on subjects I find interesting.</description>
